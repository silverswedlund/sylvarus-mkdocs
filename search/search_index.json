Most Astral-origin stones were destroyed or consumed during the God Wars.  </p> <p>Rarity:   - Varies  </p> <p>Additional Details:   - Enchantment gemstones are infused with the elemental and metaphysical forces of magic. Each stone is attuned to a specific magical domain, distinguished by its color and subtle aura. The standard method of use involves crushing the gemstone into fine dust and using it during the enchanting process to bind a magical effect to an item. However, a rarer technique involves embedding the whole gemstone directly into an item, preserving its integrity. This method is difficult, but equally potent.</p> <p>Color Associations:</p> Color Domain White Psychic (thought, mental projection, memory) Black Shadow (stealth, fear, corruption) Clear Wind (movement, agility, breath) Blue Water (control, shaping, fluidity) Red Fire (destruction, passion, energy) Green Nature (growth, poison, animal bonding) Yellow Soul (divinity, essence, resurrection) Pink Pink (emotion, joy, chaos, glamour) Purple Void (space, teleportation, scaling) Gray Warding (barriers, hardlight, anti-magic) Brown Necromancy (undeath, decay, soul binding) Orange Healing (regeneration, vitality, blood magic) Copper Sound (vibration, resonance, voice) Silver Time (acceleration, delay, memory replay) Gold Luck (fate manipulation, fortune, probability) Mint Force (telekinesis, impact, shielding) Sky Blue Lightning (speed, stormcalling, shocking touch) <p>Gemstones may glow, shimmer, or pulse depending on their alignment, and each has a distinct resonance felt by skilled enchanters. Breathing in raw gemstone dust has been known to impact the soul. For some individuals, it induces temporary berserk states, spontaneous magical surges, or prolonged enchantment sensitivity.

It is the only known metal that has a natural ability to absorb and nullify magic. It is still not fully understood how this works, though theories relate to its conductivity and atomic structure. It's very rare in nature and isn't found in the astral plane or feywild, only in the material plane, though extremely rarely. Most of Sylvarus' gold comes from the ancient temple buried under the city of Athenia. This gold was made when Midas had a group of his lich followers use a philosopher's stone to turn one of their enemies' palace to gold in order to trap, and then subsequently kill the god. Gold is very important in Orcish culture and is used in many of their artifacts and weapons, and rarely in their shields and armor. The Golden Hand uses pure gold for their weapons and armor to protect them from even the most powerful magic. It also isn't able to be magically duplicated, and nobody knows how to make philosopher's stones anymore, so no gold can be produced except through mining the existing sources.</p>"},{"location":"materials/iron/","title":"Iron","text":"<p>An [Athenia](../../planes/material/sylvarus/locations/territories/athenia/index.md) shield made of iron with a gold trim</p>"},{"location":"materials/iron/#details","title":"\ud83d\udcd5 Details","text":"<p>Type:   - Metal Properties:   - Strong   - Magnetic   - Corrodes easily  </p> <p>Uses:   - Construction   - Tools   - Weapons  </p> <p>Origin:   - Commonly found in the earth's crust  </p> <p>Rarity:   - Common  </p> <p>Additional Details:   - Widely used for its strength and availability. It can be found in the astral and material planes, but the feywilds has no natural sources of iron. Iron is strong and resilient, but it is not as strong as dragonsteel or mythril which now have a higher demand for usage in weapons and armor.

Native exclusively to the Aureate, they form a vast, interconnected supercolony known by the same name, all Aurealas in The Aureate are actually the giant plant. No Aurealas are permitted to grow outside this region, by the people of the Aureate, as their magic is sacred to the people who live among them. There is some black market trade of Aurealas, but it is strictly forbidden by the people of the Aureate. The people of the Aureate are very protective of their sacred plant and will not tolerate any harm to them unless condoned through ritual. The Aureate people's have hunters who will find and punish those who harm or harvest Aurealas without permission. </p> <p>The trees are bioluminescent at night, with leaves that glow faintly with hues ranging from violet to deep indigo. Their bark is infused with potent magical energy, often used in crafting enchanted items such as weapons, armor, and ceremonial jewelry.

Living on the jungle floor is both culturally taboo and environmentally dangerous, due to magical fauna and unstable terrain. Aurealas thrive only in the hyper-saturated magical ecosystem of the Aureate, which is similar in climate and density to the Amazon rainforest, but with rich violet and lavender coloration dominating the palette. Their flowers bloom in rhythmic pulses in sync with leyline cycles, giving the canopy an otherworldly, shimmering pattern during bloom seasons.
