# Hestia's Ascension: Trial of Inner Peace

**Divine Trial:** Attain Inner Peace  
**Era:** Age of Division

---
**Synopsis**

---

## I. Sparks

Born in a tense elven border town, Hestia forged a secret friendship with a dwarven girl—until war came. At age twelve, she awakened her divine fire in a moment of unbearable loss, burning invaders as her town fell to ash. She escaped with her siblings, swearing vengeance with every breath.

---

## II. Pyre

Orphaned and bitter, Hestia grew cold and cruel. She excelled in school and war magic, feared and admired in equal measure. A divine vision named her trial: *find inner peace*. She laughed. Peace would come after vengeance. She rose through the military, became a fire-wielding legend, and led the elven empire to crush the dwarves. Crowned Empress, she stood triumphant—and hollow.

---

## III. Ember

As Empress, Hestia brokered peace, rebuilt a shattered world, and created a golden age. Her fire turned from destruction to warmth—power wielded to protect, not punish. But peace never came to her. Nightmares persisted. Her rage no longer roared, but it never truly cooled. After a century, she abdicated and vanished, leaving her niece to inherit a thriving empire.

---

## IV. Smolder

For thirty-five years, Hestia wandered. Temples, hermits, and wisdom failed to quiet her unrest. Then, in her rebuilt hometown, she reunited with Darny—her childhood dwarven friend, now elderly. Their brief reunion healed old hatreds, but not the ache inside her. Darny died, content. Hestia wept. And walked on, the fire low, the longing unnamed.

---

## V. Flames

She rekindled love with an old flame in a quiet village, hiding under her mother’s name. For six years, she lived a gentle life, planning for marriage and a child. But when betrayal shattered her trust, rage surged once more. She nearly burned the man she loved. Seeing his true happiness with someone else, she stopped—and finally saw herself clearly. Her hatred had never been justice. It had only ever been fire.

---

## VI. Ash

Hestia fled to the Feywilds, losing herself in drink and reckless gambling. She joined young adventurers, only to find them slain by a Titan when she drunkenly wandered off. She burned the Titan to cinders—but felt nothing. Not even guilt. Only emptiness. Slowly, she honored her fallen friends not through revenge, but remembrance. She built a cabin in the wilds and began again. Then a lava slime burned her house down—and she laughed. It reminded her of herself. Small. Hungry. Burning things just to stay warm.

---

## VII. Smoke

She lived simply, alone but content, with only her strange pet for company. She no longer chased peace. No longer feared becoming a Titan. One misty morning, resting in a hammock she’d strung between two trees, she played with fire—not to fight, not to grieve, but just to see it dance.

And as she watched the still lake and the slow sky—

She felt peace.

Her flame no longer burned.

It glowed.

She ascended not in fire—

But in silence.

## Chapter I: Sparks

Under pale skies and quiet snowmelt, in a town that clung like a spiderweb to the borders of two ancient nations, a girl was born. It was a place of thin soil, deep forests, and deeper grudges. Elves lived on one side of the river; dwarves, on the other. History had left scars on both peoples—skirmishes, treaties, betrayals carved into stone—but in the border town of Brell'elmeer, necessity dulled hatred into something almost bearable.

She was born prematurely to a family of elves on their respective side of the border. Her father was a merchant, and her mother was a healer. She was the youngest of three, and her mother didn't think she would live. She was strong, though, and her parents gave her a name that meant resilience in Elvish: Hestia.

Her brother Tholalen, quick-witted and fearless, was seventeen. Her sister Sapharill, calm and stubborn, was fourteen. Hestia had just turned twelve, all wide eyes and boundless energy. She was too young to remember the last flare-up between the nations, too young to understand why the adults in town whispered when the wind blew from the east. What she did know, with the clarity only children possess, was that she had a best friend.

Her name was Darny, a dwarven girl from the stone village across the water. They met in the woods, pretending to hunt spirits and chasing fireflies, trading stories and carved beads. Darny spoke of dwarven cities beneath the mountains and how her father was making so many cool swords and blades. Hestia spoke of elven trees that bloomed once a decade and a volcano in her people's homeland that a legendary elf filled with sand the color of coal. They enjoyed each other's company and were sure they would grow up and change the world—together.

But the world isn't easily changed.

When the army came, it didn't arrive in force. Just a few scouts at first. Then came the supply caravans. Then the conscription papers. The elders called it "precaution," and no one dared speak of war aloud, but fortifications rose like weeds around the edges of Brell'elmeer. Hestia saw her brother sharpen his wooden practice sword each morning, and her father and mother arguing about the future. She saw her sister sit too long, staring into nothing. Darny stopped appearing in the woods.

Then came the fire.

It wasn't the fire Hestia would one day learn to wield. It was fire from the east—screams in the night, metal on stone, boots breaking doors. Hestia awoke to smoke, her sister yanking her from bed. Her parents were in the kitchen, shouting. Then the door splintered inward.

The soldiers wore armor of blackened steel and spoke no words. One of them grabbed their father and beat him with his metal-clad fist. He shouted at him, asking where the gold was kept. Her father told him after several blows. He was cynically thanked for his cooperation immediately before being subjected to a quick slash to the throat. Blood was everywhere.

Tholalen tried to fight and was thrown aside like a doll. Their mother was the next to rise. She reached for her husband; it wasn't too late if she could heal him. She was cut down before she could even get close.

More blood, more screams, more pain, the sound of gold being taken, and her sister screaming and crying.

Her brother was yelling and trying to fight but was subdued, and as the soldier drew his sword to kill him, Hestia felt panic, rage, fear, and hate. A wave of heat unlike anything she had ever felt before washed over her.

Time felt slow, and the world was silent.

Hestia didn't remember what she screamed. She only remembered the heat. The sound of rushing wind, of wood cracking from within. The pain—but not hers. Her skin was untouched. Her brother's and sister's faces were pale with terror, but unburned. The soldiers, the walls, the floor—everything else was flame.

Radiant, hot destruction, and she was the source. She felt her rage consume her like the fire consumed the house and the dwarves. She felt faint and dizzy.

She collapsed into Sapharill's arms as the house groaned around them.

Outside, the battle had barely begun. The dwarves, startled by the resistance, chose brutality over retreat. They set fire to the village and locked the gates that were once their safety, trapping the townspeople inside the fort to burn. They dragged out those who remained. Their mission changed from conquest to punishment.

Tholalen knew a side exit, a path through a drainage ditch, and found a path through the fields for his remaining family. He carried Hestia on his back and dragged Sapharill by the hand. The three of them ran, Sapharill barefoot and sobbing. Tholalen was sweating and breathing hard, fueled by adrenaline. Hestia was mostly unconscious, but the heat still clung to her hair like breath.

They did not look back. Not when they heard screaming. Not when the sky glowed orange.

By dawn, Brell'elmeer was gone.

They hid in the mountains for two days before help came. Soldiers from the capital—too late to save anyone. Too late to stop the burning.

Hestia stood at the edge of a cliff that morning, her brother beside her, his knuckles white on the hilt of a scavenged blade. Her sister said nothing. None of them did. Not until Hestia finally broke the silence, her voice hoarse and dry and small:

"I'll burn them all."

No one told her not to.
No one told her she was wrong.

They were all thinking it too.


## Chapter II: Pyre
They settled in the lowlands beyond the capital, in a quiet farmhouse where the air never smelled of blood. A place that didn't know the taste of war. Their grandparents were old—gentle, slow-speaking, and fond of stories that only half made sense. Her sister Sapharill took to silence. And Hestia... she smoldered.

At first, the grief hollowed her out. She didn't speak for weeks. Her grandparents tried to coax warmth from her with sweets, stories, and soft hands, but none of it reached her. The girl who used to laugh in the woods was gone. Something colder—or perhaps hotter—had taken her place.

The news of her brother Tholalen's death came three months after they arrived. He had joined the border guard, he wanted to protect and to avenge their parents and their people. A dwarven raid took him, along with seventeen others. Hestia didn't cry when they told her. She simply nodded, as if confirming something she already knew. He died distracting the enemy so that several of his comrades could escape.

He was a hero. and was posthumously awarded the black star of the empire. Hestia was proud of him, and carried the star with her everywhere she went.

School began soon after, and with it came whispers. Everyone had heard what happened in Brell'elmeer. Everyone knew about the girl who burned down half a battalion. Some feared her. Some admired her. No one understood her.

Hestia didn't make friends. She made allies.

She dominated her classes, tore through every textbook, every rune-scroll, every combat drill. She raised her hand not to ask questions, but to answer them before anyone else could. She was clever, confident, and, at times, cruel. She mocked the slow. She humiliated the proud. She won every duel.

In many ways, she was simply superior, and she knew it. On one occasion, in the academy halls, she was tearing into a fellow student who had mocked her during class. Nobody challenged her on it; some of the teachers were even afraid of her. She began hitting the "disrespectful idiot"—at first, small pushes, but they grew into a full beating.

One of her punches was intercepted by a hand. Not by her target, but by an older boy. He was a talented fighter and student. He was strong and fierce like her, but he was kind. The students watched in silence.

Nobody knew what would happen next. The last person who tried to stop her was nearly killed.

"You are a good fighter, and I know you are a smart kid," he said, "but you are a brute, a bully, and you are not a good person."

He looked around at the students, then to the beaten boy, and then back at her. 

"So, instead of beating up this smaller boy, why don't you fight me? No fire, no magic, no weapons, just you and me. Unless... you're afraid to fight without your fire?"

Students gasped, watching with wide eyes. Some tried to get teachers, but he waved them off. "No teachers, no parents, okay? This is between us students. We need to learn to deal with each other, or we'll never be able to stand up to the real enemies."

She accepted, and they fought.

It was a quick fight, but not a simple or easy one. They struck blows, grappling, dodging, and countering. He was skilled. She was too, and she was stronger and quicker than he was, but it wasn't enough. He had the experience, the discipline, the training that she lacked. She took several solid punches to the face and a kick to the ribs that likely broke several of them.

She was furious, and she wanted to win, but he was too good.

She screamed. Nothing in particular, just a shout of rage.

She felt the fire inside her growing. She wanted to burn him. She hated him like she hated the dwarves. She wanted to burn him so badly.

Her eyes glowed with the blue of her fire, and she could feel it, the power building up in her.

He saw it, and he smiled.

He dodged the first fireball, and the second, then closed the distance. With two quick movements, he broke her nose, and then her arm. With the pain, she yelled.

Proud of himself, the boy said, "You're willing to cheat to win, of course you are. You're a pathetic bully. And you're a disgrace to your family. Your parents would be ashamed of you."

"Never talk about my family again, or I will burn you alive."

"You're mad because I'm right. I think your parents would not be proud of you beating up a smaller boy."

She came alive with flames, her body clothed in fire. She was fury. She was hate. She was fire.

The boy was stunned by the display of power but gained his composure quickly.

"You're bluffing. We both know you could kill me right now. But you won't."

The next few seconds were tense. She was breathing heavily, her chest heaving, her eyes glowing with fire.

They both stood their ground, not a whisper from the crowd.

She contained her fire and walked away without a word.

She changed schools, and her grades remained high, but she was no longer a bully—she was a complete loner, barely speaking to anyone at all, the fire still raging inside her.

By fifteen, she was offered a scholarship to the best magical academy in the region. She accepted without ceremony.

Her grandparents cried with pride.

The city was grand, and the academy was older than most nations. Marble halls, flame-lit towers, dueling rings carved from obsidian. Here, she was among others with power—but few with purpose. While others trained for prestige or gold or curiosity, Hestia trained for war.

Her hatred had become precise. Focused. She stopped believing in peace altogether. The dwarves had murdered her parents. Killed her brother. Burned her home. Laughed while her village died. The empire agreed. The emperor called them lesser beings, beasts, a threat that must be eradicated.

Hestia listened. She was convinced.

By 20, after graduating from the academy, she enlisted.

She accelerated through training. The instructors praised her discipline, her technique, her raw magical output. She wielded fire like it was an extension of her breath. Her spells didn't just scorch—they roared, they hungered. Her body moved with soldierly precision. Her mind was a blade honed on memory.

And then, in her second year of service, she saw the sky open.

It was during a night patrol along a broken pass, the clouds thick and restless. A gale cut through the trees, and the moon vanished. The others panicked, blades drawn, spells summoned.

But Hestia froze.

A silver light descended, soft and vast, and with it came the shape of a creature more magnificent than she had ever seen—feathered, radiant, haloed in stormlight. A massive winged horse, glowing like the stars themselves.

"Hestia of Brell'elmeer," it said—not with words, but within her.

"Your trial is to find inner peace."

She blinked.

Then laughed.

Of all the trials the gods could give, this one seemed easy. She would finish the war. Burn the beasts. Avenge her family. Bring peace to the empire. And then she'd find her own peace, perhaps living in solitude somewhere in the woods.

The divine creature said nothing more. It simply rose, wheeled once above the mountain, and vanished into mist.

Years passed. Battles flared like brushfires, and she was in all of them.

Hestia became a name known across continents. A legend. A commander with hair like midnight and fire in her veins. Wherever she walked, the air warmed. Wherever she struck, cities fell.

Fire so intense it burned the stone cities the dwarves built.

The dwarves—divided, desperate—tried to push back. She crushed them. She razed fortresses carved into cliffs. She turned their siege engines to slag with a single word. Her troops followed her not just out of fear, but belief.

She led not from a throne, but from the front lines.

She was a general, a commander, a warrior. She won the war for the elves, drove the dwarves back to the mountains.

The old emperor was dying, and he had no heirs. He had no one to succeed him.

She had a meeting with the old elf and she 'convinced' him to declare her his heir.

When he died, Hestia was crowned in the capital's oldest temple, beneath banners of gold and coal-black. The crowd chanted her name like a prayer.

She led the empire to push their advantage, and the dwarves were soon on the brink of defeat.

She wore crimson and steel. Her hair braided with firestones. Her crown forged from the remnants of the last dwarven king's sword.

A hero. A ruler. A flame made flesh.

But when the ceremony ended, and the throne room emptied, and the cheering faded—

She stood alone.

And in the silence, something inside her whispered,

> You are no closer.

She ignored it.

She had peace to enforce.

## Chapter III: Ember
The wars didn't end immediately under her reign. Not all fires go out with a breath. But under Hestia's reign, the Empire pushed the dwarves from every contested border, crushed every resistance, and turned victory from a moment into a mandate.

The dwarves—ragged, splintered, humiliated—sued for peace.

When she first stood at the negotiation table, Hestia didn't feel rage. She didn't feel triumph. She felt... tired. The weight of a three decades of conflict had settled into her bones like ash after a great burning.

She was kinder in the negotiations than she had been in the war. More patient. More understanding. More forgiving. The fire in her veins no longer demanded vengeance—it had consumed enough.

Even still, the dwarven envoys didn't speak her name aloud. They didn't look her in the eye. And when they placed their kingdom's seal on the peace accord, Hestia felt the warmth in her chest flicker—but not with satisfaction. Something else stirred there. Something hollow.

She didn't hate them anymore. Not really.

The hate had burned itself out somewhere between her twentieth siege and her thirtieth funeral. Between the letters she wrote to parents of fallen soldiers and the ruins of cities she'd ordered razed. Hatred, she discovered, was a finite resource. Even for her.

By then, Hestia had sharpened her will and her control. She was more collected and more focused. The impulsive girl who barked orders and snapped back at teachers was gone, tempered by time and responsibility. She spoke slowly now, and rarely. When she did speak, people listened.


Her eyes no longer burned. They glowed.

She ruled for a hundred years.

She walked through fire drills with her soldiers, slept no more than four hours a night, and read more history than the palace historians. Her flames could incinerate armies, but she rarely used them anymore. She didn't need to. Her presence alone was enough.

But the fire was still there. It had changed—not into peace, but into something steady. A fire that warmed. A fire that built.

She began rebuilding the world.

The new capital was named Cindarel, a city of flame-brick and soulstone, ringed by canals and terraces carved from obsidian. The roads were heated from below, the poor were housed and fed, the cold were given wool and warmth. She commissioned schools, hospitals, granaries, all inscribed with the same phrase:

"No one shall freeze while I still burn."

Her advisors begged her to tax the nobles more, but she did not. She simply asked that they give more. And they did. Even the proudest lords feared disappointing her. Some came to admire her vision; others simply calculated the cost of defiance and found it too steep.

She never yelled. She never needed to. She no longer wanted to. The fire inside her had found purpose beyond destruction.

To the world, it looked like a golden age. Poets wrote of the Ember Empress, whose flames forged prosperity instead of war. Merchants grew wealthy in the new trade routes she established. Children played in streets that had once been battlefields.

But in her chambers—when the doors closed and the torches dimmed—Hestia dreamed of Brell'elmeer. She saw her mother fall again, her father's throat spill open. She saw the blood, the smoke, heard the screams of townsfolk pounding at locked gates. 

She had nightmares of her brother's last stand. Unlike in reality, in her dreams she was there fighting with him, but she could never save him. Sometimes, in these dreams, it was her fire that killed him while she watched in horror.

She always woke in silence, the sheets around her warm but untouched by flame. Her control never wavered, even in sleep.

One night, in her 140th year, she called for her niece.

The girl—young, brilliant, a little soft in the way Hestia had never been—was the daughter of her sister Sapharill, born years after the war ended. She had her mother's stillness and her grandmother's warmth. She spoke plainly and listened carefully.

She reminded Hestia of who she might've been—if the fire had never come.

They talked deep into the night. About war. About grief. About the cost of control. They had always had a quick rapport, and they were both good at cutting through the noise that other people always seemed to want to add.

"Are you happy, Auntie?" the girl asked as dawn approached.

Hestia considered the question longer than she should have needed to.

"I am... satisfied," she finally answered.

Her niece nodded with a sad smile, understanding the difference.

In the morning, to her niece's shock, Hestia gave her the crown.

There was no ceremony. No parade. Just a final command:

"Don't be like me. Be better."

Then Hestia vanished.

No entourage. No farewell address. No monument. Only a note left in the royal archives, written in her own hand addressed to both her niece and to the people of the empire:

"I have kept the Empire warm. It is your turn now."

She left behind a kingdom with full bellies, warm beds, and no war. A legacy that would endure for generations.

But peace? Peace never came.

Not to her.

Not yet.

---

## Chapter IV: Smolder

She left behind the capital, the court, the crown—everything she had built, everything she had burned to earn. And for the first time in her life, Hestia had no destination.

She wandered.

No entourage, no weapons but her flame. She wore traveler's robes instead of royal silk, slept beneath stars instead of carved roofs. She let her hair grow out wild, let the weight of titles slip from her shoulders. She carried only a small pack and the Black Star her brother was awarded.

For thirty-five years, she walked the roads of Sylvarus, visited monasteries carved into cliff faces, listened to spirit-singers in wind-torn deserts. She debated monks, fasted with druids, broke bread with strangers. Everyone had advice for her. None of it helped.

No matter how far she traveled, no matter how still she sat, peace never rooted inside her. Something always stirred beneath her ribs—a restlessness, a remembering.

Why do I still feel like this?

No god answered. No monk had a cure.

One dusk, in her 175th year, her boots found a familiar road.

The river bent the same way. The trees were taller now, older. But the wind still carried the same scent—damp pine, moss, smoke.

Brell'elmeer.

Not the ashes she remembered. The town had been rebuilt—new stone, new faces, but the bones of it were the same. A statue stood where the well used to be. A plaque listed the names of the fallen.

Her family's names were there. So was her brother's. And hers.

She stood before her own name for a long time.

No one in the square approached her.

A few glanced her way. A few did a double take.

But without her crimson armor, without firestones in her hair or golden flames trailing from her hands, she was just another elf passing through.

Not forgotten—unrecognized.

And somehow, that made her feel happy, though she didn't know why.

She walked the path she hadn't walked since childhood—through the woods, past the clearing where she and Darny once hunted imaginary spirits, past the place where she had once sworn to burn the world.

And there, sitting on a worn bench outside a modest apothecary, was Darny.

Older, slower, smaller than memory—but unmistakably her.

Hestia stopped, her breath catching.

Darny looked up, squinted at her, and then smiled.

"Well," the dwarf said in a raspy almost-whisper, "it only took you a century and a half."

They talked for hours. About everything. And nothing.

They talked about what had happened to their people. The lies they were told. The truths they never learned. The good done in the name of vengeance, and the evil done in the name of good.

Darny had married once. Widowed early. Had no children. She brewed medicine now, for pain and memory and for her throat. She never left the valley. She didn't need to. 

"I knew you'd come back," she whispered, pouring tea. "Eventually."

Hestia said nothing for a while. Then:

"I thought you were dead."

"I thought you'd have conquered the world by now," Darny laughed and went into an intense coughing fit.

They spent three days together.

Hestia had told her several times over the days that if there was anything Darny wanted, anything at all, she could grant it for her. Each time, Darny just smiled and whispered, "The only thing I have left that I want in this world is to see my friend be happy."

Darny showed her the rebuilt town, the people who had grown up believing Hestia was a legend—not a person. Some whispered when she passed. Some stared too long. A group of a few young ones dared ask questions.

"Are you really her?" a bold child asked.

"Depends," she would answer. "Who do you think I am?"

"Empress Hestia?" the child responded.

"Do I look like an empress to you?" Hestia said, gesturing to her wild hair and travel clothes.

The bold child's friend punched her in the arm and said, "I told you she wasn't her."

And her friends turned around and left while laughing about something.

The girl was last to turn around, but she looked back and saw Hestia smiling, a finger to her lips implying a "shhh," and then she made a slight motion with her hand and a small blue flame appeared and then vanished.

Hestia then did a zipper motion with her hand and the girl's eyes widened.

The kid did the zipper motion back and whispered something under her breath out of shock.

Hestia smiled and went back to Darny's home.

On the third evening, Darny had several coughing fits, and told Hestia that she was not long for this world.

Hestia cried. For the first time in a very, very long time, she cried.

Darny cried with her. Darny was at peace, but cried for her friend.

Darny smiled and said, "I'm not afraid. I've lived a good life. I've seen the world. I've loved and I've lost. I will be okay. And if I see your family, I will tell them how well you're doing and how proud of you they should be."

They had wine, and they talked about the past.

On the fourth morning, Hestia found her friend still in bed, eyes closed, hands folded. Peaceful.

Following the instructions in the note on Darny's nightstand, she buried her only friend under the old tree in the clearing—their clearing. The same place with the same fireflies and the same carved beads long lost in the roots.

Hestia left Brell'elmeer again, but this time she didn't run.

She walked.

No anger in her chest. No vengeance in her blood. No hatred at all.

For the first time in her long, long life, she had nothing to burn.

But still, no peace.

Only a quiet smolder.

And the whisper of something she still couldn't name.


---

## Chapter V: Flames
In the months after Darny’s death, Hestia wandered with less purpose and more weight. The warmth she’d carried from their reunion dulled faster than she expected, and what lingered was a quiet ache—not grief exactly, but something hollower. Something colder.

She realized, slowly and without ceremony, that she had almost no one left.

The throne no longer mattered to her. Her niece was now Empress, and Hestia had made peace with the fact that her time had passed. She visited only once—for the wedding of her niece and the crowning of her niece’s wife. She liked the girl. Thought she was good for her niece. Smart. Kind. Steady.

But the palace felt like a place she no longer belonged. She left quickly after the celebrations ended, and took to the road again.

One evening, she found herself writing a letter she never thought she’d send.

A few weeks later, she stood in front of an old wooden shop, its painted sign swinging gently in the breeze.

The man behind the counter was shorter than she remembered. His once-black hair had gone mostly gray, his shoulders softened with age. But his laugh still sounded the same—deep, disarming.

“Hestia…” he said, eyes widening. “You look—”

“Like shit?” she offered.

He smiled. “I was going to say familiar.”

“Well that’s awfully kind of you. I’ve been traveling for months at this point,” she said, with a weary smile and a sigh.

“Come in, come in. Get some rest. I’ll make tea, and we can catch up.”

“Sounds good to me,” she said.

“Oh—and please don’t tell anyone who I am. I don’t want the attention of a former empress.”

“I won’t. I promise. I’ll just say you’re an old flame from the army days. Not even a lie, is it?” he said with a wink and a chuckle. “But what should I call you?”

“Just call me Helia. It was my mother’s name,” she said, smiling softly.

“I’m sure she’d appreciate that,” he said with a nod.

“So, Helia... how are you doing?”

They talked for hours. She told him about her life. He told her about his.

He was a spice merchant now, living in a midsized village nestled in a quiet valley. A peaceful place. The kind of place no one ever invaded. He was well-liked—always had a joke, never let a cart leave without a sample, and refused to run for mayor no matter how often the townsfolk pushed.

“If I were mayor,” he’d say, “who would sell you cinnamon?”

She stayed.

At first, it was for tea and conversation. Then for dinners. Then for mornings that didn’t feel empty. She told no one who she was. To the villagers, she was Helia—a quiet, strong woman with sharp eyes and a soft smile. She cut her hair. Wore linen. Helped with the shop. Looked very much not like an empress.

Only he knew the truth. And he never said a word.

They felt the spark again, and their affection grew once more—but deeper now. Not forged in wartime, but in shared silences and laughter over spilled paprika.

The villagers adored her. She carried crates, listened to old stories, fixed fences. Children brought her drawings of dragons, and she pretended to be scared of them.

For a time, she thought she might stay forever.

They were engaged by spring.

They didn’t plan a grand wedding. They didn’t need to. It was understood. They’d have a child, maybe two. She’d build them a bigger home. He’d expand the shop.

She was the closest to peace she had ever known.

But peace, for her, had always been temporary.

It started small. He seemed distant whenever she mentioned her trial. At first, she thought it was discomfort—he’d never liked talking about divine matters. But it grew. When she spoke about the future—about names, about safety, about maybe having a child—he changed the subject.

They argued more.

She accused. He deflected.

Eventually, she asked him plainly why he was pushing her away.

He said he didn’t know. That he just needed space.

But she knew. She had always known.

She loved him more than he loved her.

One evening, coming home early from the market, she found him in the alley behind the shop. Not alone.

He was laughing.

Not nervously. Not guiltily.

Genuinely.

He hadn’t laughed like that in years—not with her.

And then he kissed the woman on the lips.

The fire rose in her without asking.

She didn’t cry. She didn’t scream.

She burned.

The walk back to their home was slow and silent. Her hands trembled with heat. Her vision blurred with fury. She remembered the way the soldiers looked when they killed her father. She remembered how she looked when she killed them.

This betrayal felt worse. Because this time, it was someone she had let her guard down for. Someone she had trusted with the only gentle parts of herself.

And now those parts were in ashes.

She tracked him down the next day, fury building like it hadn’t in decades.

The fire was nearly uncontainable.

She found him in the forest, again with the other woman.

The fire built up. She wanted to burn them both. Wanted to burn the spice shop. Burn the village. Burn the entire world.

And she could do it.

She could burn everything.

But they were happy. Laughing together. Joking.

Not in some shallow, stolen way—but real. She could see it. And suddenly, the flames inside her flickered, confused.

He had never been that happy with her.

Maybe he had tried. Maybe he couldn’t. Maybe she’d asked him to love something too heavy.

Her hands still glowed, but she didn’t raise them.

She stood in the shadow of the cottage until the heat in her chest began to dissolve.

She breathed. Slowly. Steadily.

And then she turned, and walked away.

She was about to burn someone in hate. Someone she loved. Someone who had once been kind to her.

She was going to escalate, to destroy, to kill—because of her fury.

Just as the dwarves had burned her town in theirs.

Just as she had burned theirs.

All this time, she had told herself her fire was righteous. That her wrath was a weapon against evil.

But it had always been hate.

She had been an instrument of vengeance cloaked in legacy. A blade called justice, sharpened by pain.

The war. The empire. The fame. The power. The glory.

It had all been so, so pointless.

She left him a letter that night.

It read only:

“I forgive you. Be happy together.”

And she walked into the dark, alone.

Again.

## Chapter VI: Ash

She left quietly. No confrontation. No ceremony.

The warmth of the village, the spice shop, the mornings filled with simple joy—gone, like breath on a mirror. She couldn’t bear to see him again. Not with her eyes. Not with the flame still smoldering in her chest.

So she vanished.

She crossed the veil into the Feywilds.

It was the only place that made less sense than her own thoughts.

There, among shifting skies and laughing trees, she drank. She gambled. She wasted time and pain in equal measure. She was a great gambler when sober—calculating, unreadable, nearly unbeatable. But when drunk, she was famously terrible, and word spread quickly. Fey merchants and curious outlaws took advantage, and she let them. She lost fortunes. It didn’t matter. She had plenty left over from her former life.

When the boredom returned—and it always did—she sought out something new.

She joined a group of younger adventurers, bright-eyed and reckless. They were on a quest to retrieve some artifact for a patron Hestia didn’t bother to remember. She didn’t care about the prize. She just wanted distraction, and they were charming, if naïve. They welcomed her eagerly, not knowing who she was. Just a fire-wielding traveler with a quiet laugh and tired eyes.

They called her Ash.

One night, midway through their journey, she slipped away to a nearby cave to drink in peace. She didn’t tell anyone. She just wanted to be alone with her bottle and her regrets.

She passed out by the mouth of the cave.

And when she returned the next morning, the camp was silent.

Too silent.

The adventurers—her companions, her brief flicker of connection—were gone. Torn apart. Burned. Scattered. Something had come in the night, while she slept and destroyed them.

The bottle rolled from her hand as she stared at what was left of them.

it broke on the ground, and the sound was like a knife to her chest.

She didn’t scream. She didn’t cry.

She ignited.

The forest caught fire as she hunted. Her flames were wild, her fury raw. She tore through underbrush and shattered trees following the trail of the blood and magic.

And she found it. A Titan, a rare creature that she may one day become, if she failed her trial. The titan was bloated with stolen power it contained the souls of her companions and many others, she could feel them.

The titan was slightly humanoid, but very hairy and had scales and antennae. It had compound eyes, and was dragging the trinkets of the dead like trophies in a roughly made cart.

She could see the souls in its eyes, and she could feel them pleading with her.

the beast saw her coming, with her fury. and it roared.

She unleashed everything.

The sky cracked with heat. The ground boiled. She didn’t fight the titan—she annihilated it.

And when it was over, and the monster was nothing but scorched bone and ash—

The cart off to the side was still warm, slightly smoldering.

She extinguished the fire from the cart, and she saw the sould float up out of the bones of the titan and go to the underworld, where they would be at peace.

peace...

She felt nothing.

She saved the souls, but she didn't feel anything. No satisfaction. No closure...

Just smoke and ash.

She stood among the remains, breathing shallowly. The adrenaline faded. The grief didn’t come.

That frightened her more than anything.

Over the next few days, she collected what was left. Not just bones, but satchels, journals, lucky tokens. Bits of who they had been. She buried what was left of their bodies, one by one. Then, over months, she sought out their families. Returned the keepsakes. Wrote letters. Spoke names.

Not out of guilt.

Not out of shame.

But because she had cared. And she knew what it was to lose people and be left with nothing but silence.

She returned to the Feywilds.

But this time, not to drink.

She went deeper, into the parts where the chaos ran thick and magic dripped from the air like dew. She built a small cabin—crooked, simple, hers. She hunted her food. She meditated at sunrise. She learned to sit still, and to sit with herself.

Weeks passed. Then months.

She didn’t try to be better. She didn’t chase peace.

She simply endured.

One day, returning from a quiet hunt, she found smoke curling from her cabin.

It had burned down.

Again. Her home was gone. Up in flames and smoke. How many times? How many burned homes? How many burned lives?

She stood in front of the smoldering wreckage, blinking slowly. Tired.

There, near the ashes, sat a small creature—round, glowing faintly, bubbling gently as it devoured the remains of one of her leather boots.

A lava slime.

Rare. Clumsy. Hungry. The obvious source of the fire.

It looked up at her and tilted slightly, as if confused. Then it waddled toward her, mistaking the warmth of her fire magic for actual flame.

She stared.

And then, finally—she chuckled.

A small, rasping sound. Not bitter. Not wild.

Amused.

She sat cross-legged on the moss. She cast a simple heat protection charm and the lava slime nuzzled her leg, its body singeing the ground as it moved.

She could rebuild the cabin. Or she could move on. Either was fine. She didn’t care much.

She reached out to pet the creature. It pulsed happily, its core glowing brighter. She fed it a flicker of conjured flame.

It squeaked, content.

She looked around.

No home. No family. No throne. No rage. No fire.

No hate.

No shame.

No ambition.

Just her, and a lava slime, and the strange little lives they had both lived—burning things along the way, just trying to find warmth.

She wasn’t healed. She wasn’t whole.

But for the first time in centuries, she felt...

Okay.

And that was enough.

## Chapter VII: Smoke

The cabin was gone, but the glade remained.

She never rebuilt.

She didn’t need to.

The wilds of the Fey no longer felt like a maze or an escape—they just felt like home. The trees shifted when they wanted. The sky sometimes shimmered blue at midnight. Birds occasionally spoke in rhymes. It didn’t matter. She let it all be.

The lava slime stayed.

It was dumb, hungry, clumsy—and she adored it. It followed her on short walks, left molten trails on her boots, tried to eat her bedroll twice. She named it Moth. Not because it resembled one—it didn’t. But because it was drawn to flame, just like her. Just like everyone she’d ever known.

They lived quietly.

No plans. No ambition.

She cooked. She hunted. She carved wood with flickers of fire that danced between her fingers.

Sometimes, she wandered into strange Fey villages, sold small trinkets, traded warmth for stories. They thought she was odd. Some whispered that she might be a god, or a witch, or the ghost of something old.

She never corrected them.

She just smiled, bought sugar cubes for Moth, and left before anyone got too curious.

She didn’t want to ascend anymore.

Not because she feared becoming a Titan—those days were behind her. It wasn’t fear. It wasn’t longing either.

It was apathy.

Not a cruel or broken one. Just a quiet letting-go.

She had tried so hard for so long. Tried to win peace through power. Tried to atone. Tried to fix herself. Burned cities, built empires, buried friends.

And now, she simply didn’t care whether the gods watched or not.

Let them.

One morning, the mist rolled in thicker than usual.

It clung to her little patch of forest like breath on glass.

She sat in a hammock she’d fashioned from vines and wool—half magic, half guesswork—strung between two leaning trees. Moth snored beneath her in a warm, hissing puddle.

A lake lay just beyond the rise. Still. Pale. Mirrored.

She stared at it, half-awake, her fingers toying idly with fire.

Tiny dragons danced between her palms—blue flame and whimsy. One unfurled wings. Another breathed a puff of smoke and vanished. She wasn’t thinking about anything in particular. Just... watching.

The forest breathed. The slime purred. The world turned.

She looked at the water. She looked at the sky.

She felt the quiet.

Felt the weight she no longer carried.

And she felt—

Peace.

Real peace. The kind that didn’t feel like surrender or forgetting.

Just presence.

Just breath.

Her fire didn’t rage.

It warmed.

And then, with no thunder, no trumpet, no blaze of divine heraldry—

She ascended.

Not in flame. Not in fury.

But in stillness.

Smoke rose gently from her hammock, curling upward, soft and slow.

A flicker of heat.

A glow without burn.

Moth snored on, unaware.

And the forest kept breathing.
