      "history": "The Smiling God was born from pure intent: a community's desire to uplift one another. Over time, this well-meaning group began worshipping a symbolic statue of joy. That belief deepened, becoming obsession, and eventually manifested the Smiling God. Their doctrine transformed into enforced positivity—happiness at any cost. Their cult has risen and collapsed multiple times across history, but they always return, drawn to hope and good will like roots to water.",
      "physical_description": "A towering figure, 7 feet tall, with a slightly chubby build and a smooth, statue-like body. Their smile is unnaturally wide and ever-present. Their head is slightly larger than proportionate, giving them a surreal, childlike yet unsettling presence. Their eyes never blink. Their surface resembles polished marble or ceramic.",

      "current_status": "Active and worshipped within the Sanctified Penitentiary, a self-contained prison-temple. His influence spreads slowly into reform institutions and militaristic orders.",
      "history": "Father Finn began as a druid who revered nature and believed humanity should live in harmony with its place in the world. Assigned to a brutal prison as chaplain, he became a source of strength for inmates—not through comfort, but through discipline. When prisoners resisted release, fearing the loss of structure, their belief transformed Finn into a Fidari. He now rules the penitentiary with calm authority. The harsh routines of prison life have become sacred rites. Obedience is salvation. Escape is heresy.",
      "physical_description": "A towering, muscular man standing 8 feet tall and weighing over 500 pounds. His body is scarred and heavily built. He wears garments that blend 1700s prison uniforms with clergy robes, adorned with heavy chains and silver locks—especially around his ankles. His eyes swirl with unnatural colors, reflecting the chaos and belief from which he was born. He is stoic, commanding, and never raises his voice.",
      "relationships": [
        "Ideologically opposed to the Smiling God’s doctrine of joy—though both enforce order through belief.",
        "Feared and respected by many lower Fidari who lack his level of stability or infrastructure."
