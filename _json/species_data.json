Another common practice is the creation of 'chaos gardens' - spaces where multiple potential realities overlap, creating impossible landscapes that shift and transform based on the observer's perspective.

These courts are fluid, with Fey moving between them as their nature evolves. Art is central to Fey existence, though their creations often incorporate elements that change or transform the viewer in subtle ways. Music, in particular, holds special significance, with Fey compositions containing harmonies that mortals find extremely catchy and often cathartic.
