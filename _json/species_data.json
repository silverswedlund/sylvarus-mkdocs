There is some black market trade of Aurealas, but it is strictly forbidden by the people of the Aureate. The people of the Aureate are very protective of their sacred plant and will not tolerate any harm to them unless condoned through ritual. The Aureate people's have hunters who will find and punish those who harm or harvest Aurealas without permission. \n\nThe trees are bioluminescent at night, with leaves that glow faintly with hues ranging from violet to deep indigo. Their bark is infused with potent magical energy, often used in crafting enchanted items such as weapons, armor, and ceremonial jewelry. However, harvesting any part of an Aureala is only permitted through a ritualized exchangeâ€”performed by druids or sanctioned mages of the Aureate.\n\nThe inhabitants of the Aureate build their homes high in the trees, using the massive trunks and wide limbs of the Aurealas as foundations for elevated villages. Living on the jungle floor is both culturally taboo and environmentally dangerous, due to magical fauna and unstable terrain.\n\nAurealas thrive only in the hyper-saturated magical ecosystem of the Aureate, which is similar in climate and density to the Amazon rainforest, but with rich violet and lavender coloration dominating the palette. Their flowers bloom in rhythmic pulses in sync with leyline cycles, giving the canopy an otherworldly, shimmering pattern during bloom seasons. Given their Sacred status, the Aureate people don't construct their tree villiages out wood, but rather out of netting, metals, and stone"

Its bark emits a faint magical glow, and its thorns can sometimes resemble crystalline spines. The blooms secrete a red, sap-like fluid that is magically conductive and used in ritual magic.\n\nSoulblights emit a distinct magical signature, highly reactive to soul-aspected energies. Prolonged exposure to the plant can affect a personâ€™s dreams, memories, or emotional state. Their seeds are especially dangerous: when ground or distilled, they act as potent soul poison, capable of unraveling a creatureâ€™s spiritual essence without leaving a physical mark. For this reason, Soulblight seeds are highly restricted or banned in many magical societies.\n\nThough native to the Feywilds, their presence can warp nearby flora. Rumors persist that particularly large or old Soulblights have a limited awareness, turning slightly when watched or humming faintly in high magical winds. Fey botanists treat the plant with a blend of awe and caution, noting its usefulness in soul magic but warning of its unpredictable behavior near chaotic ley lines.",
