It appears naturally in the material plane, though extremely rarely. Most of sylvarus' gold comes from the ancient temple burried under the city of Athenia. This gold was made when Midas had a group of his lich followers use a philiopher's stone to turn one of their enemies palace to gold and killed the god. Gold is very important in Orcish culture and is used in many of their artifacts and weapons, and rarely in their shields and armor. the Golden hand uses pure gold for their weapons and armor to protect them from even the most powerful magic."

Though, pure iron still serves useful in many applications. Specifically when dealing with ghosts, spectres, and fey, where it is more effective than dragonsteel or mythril due to their natural weaknesses to iron."
