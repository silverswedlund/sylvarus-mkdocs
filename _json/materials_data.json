However, a rarer technique involves embedding the whole gemstone directly into an item, preserving its integrity.

Most of Sylvarus' gold comes from the ancient temple buried under the city of Athenia. This gold was made when Midas had a group of his lich followers use a philosopher's stone to turn one of their enemies' palace to gold in order to trap, and then subsequently kill the god. Gold is very important in Orcish culture and is used in many of their artifacts and weapons, and rarely in their shields and armor. The Golden Hand uses pure gold for their weapons and armor to protect them from even the most powerful magic. It also isn't able to be magically duplicated, and nobody knows how to make philosopher's stones anymore, so no gold can be produced except through mining the existing sources.",
