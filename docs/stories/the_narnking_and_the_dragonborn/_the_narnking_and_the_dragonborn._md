# Story

Odinn was born in a humble village in the far south of Narnlund. He was born with a special kind of soul—one double-kissed by the divine. He was a Sparkbearer—a soul with a divine spark which Odinn was destined to bear. The spark granted him immense strength and longevity, along with an unalterable destiny. Each Sparkbearer receives a trial unique to them. Odinn got his in his sixteenth year, when the primordial dragon Fafnir appeared in a vision and spoke the words that would shape his future: *Your trial: "Live an honorable life, and die an honorable death."* From that moment, the path of his life was set in stone.

As a member of the giant race, the Narn, Odinn's honor was already bound to the strict codes of his people. To lead with strength and to die defending one's name—these were the highest virtues. He became a king early in his life, and though he possessed great might, he never sought glory or conquest. He was a warrior, yes, but not for pride. He led with caution, with wisdom, and with a fierce desire to bring his people home from every battle. Each choice he made, each war he waged, was guided by his trial.

With his realm prosperous and his people content, Odinn prepared for the final stage of his trial. A peaceful death would not suffice. Following Narn tradition, he issued a challenge: any warrior who could defeat him in single combat would claim his collected treasures—and unknowingly complete his divine trial.

Decades passed with the challenge open. Many answered the challenge. None succeeded. Some challengers died. Most left humbled. And the weight of an unfinished trial continued to press upon the king's broad shoulders.

---

Then came Alytica.

He arrived not with sword drawn, but with scrolls tucked under his arm. An aging dragonborn with striking eyes and a sharp wit, Alytica made no attempt to hide the absurdity of his request. He stood before the throne, bowed only half-seriously, and said:

"We both know as of now, I couldn't defeat you in a duel, King Odinn. I doubt anyone short of a god could waltz in here and take you on. So rather than waste both our time with a fight right now, I have a better offer. Train me. Teach me in Narn magic. Teach me how to kill you."

Silence fell in the court. And Odinn, curious despite himself, agreed with a stipulation.

"I can teach Narn magic, but it is dangerous, and it is not something I will teach just anyone. I will train you, and evaluate you—if you impress me, I will teach you. If you do not, you will leave here with nothing more than a bruise or two."

Alytica bowed and smiled and said:

 "I understand, and thank you for the chance. I will aim not to disappoint you—and perhaps, if I am lucky, you get a bruise or two as well."

At first, it was simply sparring and philosophy. Though Alytica was already a skilled fighter, Odinn pushed him far beyond his limits, showing him techniques that would challenge even seasoned warriors. The battlemage met each new challenge with determination, but there was something different about him. Beneath his fast smile and sharp tongue was a soul searching for something—truth, perhaps, or maybe redemption.

For weeks, Alytica trained in basic combat and sparring, never once mentioning Narn magic again. But Odinn saw how the dragonborn's eyes would linger on his demonstrations, studying every movement with keen interest. Finally, after proving his dedication through countless bruising sessions, Odinn decided to broach the subject himself.

Narn magic, Odinn explained, was no mere tool. It was a sacred technique—one that bound the soul to the bloodstream, igniting divine energy within the body. Dangerous, taxing, and rarely taught to outsiders. But Alytica proved himself worthy, not just through strength or intellect, but through persistence. He returned to the training grounds each day bruised, bloodied, and grinning.

Odinn watched him grow—not only stronger, but closer.

The cabin was in Northern Noridge, nestled beside a quiet stream, snuggled among the trees and home to Alytica's garden. It became a retreat for the two. Far from the demands of kingship and study. A place where they could train and rest in peace. It was here that their bond quietly transformed.

Despite their differences in size, power, and origin, Odinn and Alytica found in each other a rare and unexpected kind of kinship. Both loners by nature, they slipped into quiet companionship with ease.

There, surrounded by the whispering trees and running water, they trained and spoke. Alytica tended to the garden, where he grew herbs and vegetables, and magical plants for his spells and potions. Often, he would be found meditating by the stream, his mind as still as the water, drawing strength and clarity from the natural world around him.

Odinn would hunt the woods for food, and they would cook together.

Sparring matches became a daily ritual, their movements fluid, synchronized. On one such day, a blast of deflected energy sent Alytica slipping on the moss-slick rocks near the stream's edge.

He yelped as he stumbled, arms flailing. A moment of surprise, that was rare for the dragonborn.

Odinn caught him instinctively, his massive hand closing around Alytica's wrist and pulling him back to solid ground. They stood still, close. Their hands didn't separate. For a moment, neither spoke.

Their eyes met.

Odinn was the first to look away. "You should watch your footwork," he said, gently, releasing his grip.

But something unspoken had passed between them—something both of them recognized but neither yet named.

As days passed, their conversations deepened beyond training. By the campfire one starlit evening, Alytica shared stories from his youth. His eyes sparkled with mischief as he recalled an incident from his early days studying magic.

As the days passed, their conversations drifted beyond training. One starlit evening by the campfire, Alytica began sharing stories from his youth. His eyes sparkled with mischief as he recounted a particular incident from his early days studying magic.

“I was just a boy,” he said. “Found this beautiful pink gemstone on the side of the village’s main road—looking back, I’m guessing it must’ve fallen off a merchant’s cart or something. Anyway, like any kid with a potion obsession, I’d heard gemstone dust was used in some brews.”

He grinned. “So I asked my teacher if I could try it out. He said no—that it was way too advanced for me at the time. But... well... I’ve always been one to experiment.”

Alytica leaned forward, eyes gleaming. “So I snuck into the academy’s potion house after hours, when no one was around. I was determined to see what would happen if I mixed a little of that pink dust into a basic smoke potion I’d just learned the week before.

“There I was, standing beside this gently bubbling cauldron, thinking, ‘Just a pinch should do it.’ Next thing I know—BOOM! Most spectacular explosion I’d ever seen. It was like I summoned the sun before its time to rise... if the sun were pink.

“I think the cauldron shielded me from the blast—I must've been enchanted for that kind of thing. But the roof? Not so lucky. Came crashing down a few seconds later.”

He chuckled, wiping away tears of laughter. “Smoke and pink mist just billowed out of that place. I stepped outside and saw it had settled over the entire village. And it—ahem—turned every piece of clothing within a mile bright pink. For weeks.”

He paused, then added, barely holding back another laugh, “Picture it—me, covered in soot, standing outside the ruins, and the poor headmaster running out in his now vibrant pink nightshirt, only to see this child smiling at the debris.”

Odinn let out a rare, genuine smile.

Alytica leaned back, sighing contentedly. “I’ll say this—the explosion itself? Beautiful. Magnificent. But I Learned two important lessons that day: never underestimate magic... and pink?...” His eyes twinkled. “Definitely not the headmaster’s color.”


Odinn laughed—a deep, unguarded sound that surprised even him. It had been a long time since he’d laughed like that.

A few weeks later, during one particularly intense sparring session, Alytica misjudged Odinn's momentum. A heavy blow slammed into his chest, shattering ribs and tearing muscle. He fell hard, breath gone, pain blooming like fire through his side.

Odinn dropped everything and rushed to him, panic in his voice, his healing magic already glowing around his hands. "I misjudged my blow, I'm sorry."

Alytica coughed, smiling weakly. "You were perfect. We both know you'll have to go all out."

Odinn sat back on his heels, worry heavy in his chest. "I don't know if I can do this. I've spent my whole life preparing for this trial. But I never imagined..."

Alytica placed a hand over Odinn's as healing light seeped into his skin. "I won't lie. I'm not sure either of us can do this. But I'll be there. You won't face this alone."

"No, that's not what I'm concerned about" Odinn said. "I've carried burdens and responsibilities for a long time, and I've learned to bear them. I'm more concerned about... In the moment, in the end. I don't know if I will be able to force myself to give everything I have to the fight... I just... I hate hurting you. You've never shown me anything but kindness and respect. I just... I don't want to hurt you."

Alytica gave a faint smile. He kissed the back of Odinn's hand and laid it back over his chest. Odinn's voice was low when he answered.

"The stream. That moment. This... there's something between us. I don't know what it means yet, but I know I want to be beside you. No matter what happens."

Alytica smiled softly. "We'll find a way together."

Odinn hugged him gently, kissed his forehead, and whispered, "Thank you for everything you've done for me."

"Rest now," Odinn said. Alytica already drifting into sleep as the healer was summoned.

---

The next day, they trained again. Harder. Closer.

Alytica pushed himself to the edge. Odinn pushed back. Though Alytica was improving fast—sharp, agile, inventive—he still couldn't overpower Odinn. Not yet.

After lunch, Alytica asked Odinn to fight at full strength. No holding back.

Odinn agreed, solemn as a storm. The duel that followed was breathtaking. Fire met steel, spell met spell. Alytica held his own, even landed a few hits. But Odinn remained faster, stronger.

In the final clash, Odinn found an opening and drew back a devastating punch aimed at Alytica's chest—the same place he'd been injured before. But just before contact, he stopped. Inches away.

"I win," he said with a grin.

Alytica sighed dramatically, then laughed. He grabbed Odinn's hand and pulled him into a hug.

They savored the moment, and then they looked at each other, the same look, the same feelings in their eyes.

Then, slowly, Alytica kissed him.

Odinn kissed him back.

"I love you," Odinn said.

"I love you too," Alytica replied.

From that moment on, they no longer returned to separate chambers. They trained together by day, slept in each other's arms by night.

A few weeks later, Odinn brought Alytica to the stream, to the same mossy stone where they had once first held hands.

Odinn's voice was quiet, almost hesitant. "I'm... not good with words like this. But being with you, training together, sharing meals and stories..." He paused, gathering his thoughts. "These months have meant everything to me. And I know now that I want..." His hand found Alytica's, squeezing gently. "I want to walk this path with you, always. Will you marry me?"

Alytica smiled. "When I came to you, I didn't think this was how the story would go. But gods, I'm glad it did. I love you. It would be an incredible honor to be your husband."

They were married in the cabin that evening, alone in the woods. There was no crowning, no court, no priestly blessing, though all of that would come in time. Instead, they were happy with hands held and promises made. It was peace, carved out from the storm of their fates.

---

Odin believed that their anniversary was going to be peaceful.

A year had passed since their marriage, and their bond had only deepened. Alytica had grown stronger—faster in combat, more precise with his spells. Yet even as he improved, the distance between them in sheer power remained daunting. Odinn was still a Sparkbearer, still a Narn. Still, perhaps, too strong.

Alytica noticed his husband growing quieter. He would catch him staring into space during training, lost in thought. He didn't need to ask what weighed on him. They both knew—the trial was still unfulfilled, and though Alytica was still improving, he was not yet strong enough to defeat his husband in combat and might never be.

During their sparring sessions, Alytica had begun spending more time in his garden between matches, claiming he needed herbs for healing potions. But his eyes would often drift to an empty plot he'd been preparing, testing the soil with strange instruments, measuring the angle of sunlight that fell there.

He'd taken to reading ancient botanical texts late into the night, when he thought Odinn was asleep. One night, Odinn had stirred to find him poring over a particularly old tome, its pages filled with illustrations of otherworldly flora. Alytica had closed the book when he noticed Odinn watching and told him it was a book about the history of the Feywild and he should go back to sleep.

So, several weeks before their anniversary, Alytica made a choice.

The Narn, as children, get sick and are susceptible to poisons, but as adults, they are known for being immune to both.

And yet, Alytica had heard of a flower that would be a poison, not to the body, but to the soul.

He recently found an excuse to go on a trip to the Feywild, where he had traded a rare and powerful artifact for some seeds.

Which he planted in his garden. He dried the flowers and crushed them.

And for their anniversary meal, he had it woven into the seasoning of Odinn's favorite dish.

It's not a poison that would kill Odinn, but it would be a poison that would sap his soul, dimming his divine spark just enough to tilt the coming duel in Alytica's favor. One that his Narn immunity would not protect him from.

They returned to the cabin in Noridge. Odinn, though king, had appointed trustworthy stewards and rarely needed to govern directly. The cabin had become their refuge.

That night, Alytica cooked them a feast for their anniversary. It was rich, aromatic, full of familiar flavors—and subtly laced with the soulblight extract of a rare Feywild flower.

The toxin wouldn't kill Odinn. It wouldn't even make him ill. It would do something far more specific: it would sap the strength of his soul, dimming his divine spark just enough to tilt the coming duel in Alytica's favor.

Odinn suspected nothing—until Alytica insulted him.

He stood after dinner and spoke sharp words, calling Odinn a coward, a selfish king, a man hiding behind his power. In Narn culture, such accusations could not be ignored. They were a challenge, plain and unmissable.

Odinn didn't respond. He stood quietly, face unreadable. They walked together out of the cabin, past the gardens Alytica had tended that morning, and down to the stream—the same spot where Odinn had once proposed.

There, the duel began.

At first, Odinn fought cautiously, unsure of Alytica's intentions. Alytica responded with restraint—shields, dodges, deflections—stalling. Watching.

Then the storm broke.

Alytica unleashed his full strength. Plasma magic lit the sky in burning arcs, crashing into the earth like thunder. His veins and eyes black with Narn magic. He moved like fire given form, a whirlwind of elemental precision. Odinn blocked, countered, pushed back—but something was wrong.

He was slow.

His limbs felt heavy, his vision blurred at the edges. When he called on his divine magic, it faltered. He felt… sick.

A sensation he hadn't known since childhood.

And then he remembered. The strange flowers in the garden, the books Alytica was reading at night. The trip to the Feywilds. He knew that somehow, his husband had successfully poisoned him.

He looked across the battlefield, eyes wide with understanding.

"You poisoned me," he said.

Alytica, bruised and panting, met his gaze. "Your trial never required an honorable opponent, my love."

They fought on.

Even diminished, Odinn was a titan in combat. Every strike shook the streambed, every roar of magic scorched the trees. The duel was mythic—lightning in the skies, fire in the earth. The cabin burned. The garden was ash. The stream swelled with power.

But Alytica was no longer just a scholar. He was a weapon Odinn had forged with his own hands. And in the end, he was enough.

Odinn fell, not in failure, but in fulfillment.

He smiled as he collapsed, the last light of his divine spark flaring white-hot. His body vanished in a brilliant flash, ascension finally complete.

A god was born.

And Alytica stood alone at the streamside, weeping through a smile, knowing he had both slain and saved the man he loved.

---

Far above the mortal realm, nestled in the gleaming halls of the Demeran pantheon, a god was watching.

They always needed one of their rank to watch when a Sparkbearer's trial approached its end. It was tradition, yes—but also law. The Pact of Olympus, signed millennia ago, forbade divine interference in mortal trials. To ensure this law was kept, a record keeper and observer was required.

During this age, the duty of being the record keeper and observer was Inkozana's. She was not a mighty war goddess or high judge of cosmic law—her following was modest, her political sway middling. But she had a job, and she performed it with care.

Inko was the keeper of Sparkbearer records. It was her duty to document their lives, track their progress, and file formal reports upon the conclusion of each trial. Regardless of whether the bearer ascended or fell, became a god or a titan, she had to watch, document and report.  Over the years, she had watched Odinn's life unfold like the slow turning of a great wheel—each step heavy with meaning, every choice carved by emotion and diligence and fate.

She watched with rapt attention as the final duel ended and Odinn's body vanished in a flash of white, she made a quiet note in her scroll.

Trial complete. Ascension successful.

There was only one more thing to note before she prepared to turn her attention to the next Sparkbearer, not yet born. 

Each ascension left behind a relic: the Olympic item, an object dear to the newly ascended that absorbed a portion of their divine power. But there was no item. No sword, no cloak, no pendant.

She searched for the item, but found that nothing glowed with the divine light of the Olympification. Nothing... except Alytica.

Inko blinked, then blinked again.

"Oh," she whispered to herself. "Oh, that's new."

She looked at the scroll. and wrote "alytica??" in the field marked "Olympic item".

And then without further delay, she gathered her records and marched to the divine council chambers, where a hearing on import laws into Olympia was dragging on with divine slowness. She pushed open the doors.

"Hello, I apologize for the interruption, but I have something more important."

Apollo—resplendent, smug—barely glanced up. "Unless it's a pantheon collapsing or the start of a god war, I'd rather not—"

"Odinn completed his trial," she interrupted.

He sighed. "Yes, yes. Another god joins the roster. We'll send a fruit basket."

Inko smirked. "The Olympic item... It was a person. His husband, Alytica."

Silence.

Then chaos.

---

At the streamside, Alytica stood alone. Seconds before he just watched his husband ascend. He had done it. He had fulfilled the impossible. He had saved Odinn from the fate of a Titan.

He looked out over the ruined garden, the scorched trees, the ashes of their home. Though the destruction was great, the loss was not. Now that Odinn was a god, they could build a new home. 

And in that stillness, he felt a strange energy stir softly in his body.

A side effect of the Narn magic he thought. Often there was tingling and a strange feeling of power after a sparring session. But this felt different somehow.

He shrugged it off and started walking to the streambank.

Then, the energy exploded in him.

It surged through him like lightning caught in blood. His veins burned. His vision whited out. He stumbled to his knees, gasping as his scales glowed brighter than fire. His breath came shallow, as though something vast and ancient was crawling into his soul.

Pain, and silence.

Then… power.

And then the pain vanished as swiftly as it had come, but the power remained. He opened his eyes— his vision back to normal. He no longer felt weak from the duel, he saw his wounds visible close before him. He felt not exhaustion, but vitality. His soul hummed with something divine.

He looked down at his hands.

They glowed faintly, just at the edges and then the light faded.

but the power remained.

Around him, the world was still. Odinn's body was gone. He noticed. No armor. No sword. No relic.

Only Alytica remained.

He sat by the stream, processing the impossible. A relic was a certainty. One was always created upon ascension. 

He tried casting a simple spell—just a flicker of light—and it exploded in his hand, several times stronger than intended.

"Right," he muttered to himself, blinking at the afterimage. "So that's happening."

He closed his eyes and took a long, deep breath. The truth was undeniable— Somehow, some way, he had become the Olympic item. This, as far as he knew, was not possible, and it had never happened before. Olympic were items. They were indestructible artifacts of immense power, yes, but they were always items. But it seemed he was an exception.

His husband was a god now. He knew it in his bones. And something within him had changed as well. He wasn't sure how to describe it. He was… more.

He sent up a quiet prayer.

Not because he thought it would be heard. But because it felt right.

"I love you," he whispered to the wind. "Wherever you are."

He stood up and stumbled, not physically, but emotionally weak.

He walked to the streambank and sat down.

He closed his eyes and took a long, deep breath - he started meditating.

---

Some minutes later, a sudden gust swept through the ruined clearing. Alytica's eyes opened as a figure appeared—calm, composed, and slightly awkward in posture.

"Um hi," she said, brushing windblown hair from her face. "I'm Inkozana. But everyone calls me Inko."

Alytica didn't move. A curious look on his face. "You're a god."

"Uh, yeah, I am. And I'm here because something very strange just happened." She paused. "Your husband ascended, which, congratulations. But you… you became the Olympic item."

Alytica tilted his head with a faint smile. "I figured. Kind of hard to miss."

Inko smiled faintly. "That's… not supposed to be possible."

"Well..." Alytica said with a tired chuckle "I do have a tendency to ruin well-established systems."

She laughed. "I see... Well, that's why the divine council wants to speak with you. Kind of... right now..."

Alytica grew stoic for a moment, then asked only one thing: "Will I get to see him?"

"After the hearing. I'll try my best"

"Okay then - How do I get there?"

"Oh, no worries about that, I'll take you there. Are you ready?"

Alytica nodded.

With a snap of her fingers, they vanished.

---

They reappeared in a vast, formal chamber. Alytica found himself sitting in a different posture, in a chair instead of the floor, he was in the middle of a chamber which looked like a formal courtroom. Eight chairs stood in a semicircle. higher up than he, presumably council seats

Five of the seats were filled. Alytica recognized most of the gods seated, and all of them looked at him with curiosity.

Hera, Fortuna, Athena, Midas, Gilgamesh - These were five of the eight pantheonic leaders. The most powerful gods there were.

Inko led him to a single chair in the center of the room and introduced him.

"Tell us what exactly happened," Hera said quietly, her young face belying ancient eyes.

Fortuna leaned forward, power rippling beneath her calm exterior. "The flower - describe its effects precisely."

Gilgamesh tilted his head, studying him with piercing eyes. "And the combat itself - walk us through each phase."

He answered their questions as best he could. Athena's gentle prompting helped draw out details he hadn't thought to mention. Even Midas, fidgeting restlessly in his seat, listened intently.

"The Narn magic" Fortuna pressed. "When and how did you learn it and how much of it did you use during the duel?"

"Over a year ago is when I first started training it - I used it almost constantly during the duel - I was holding nothing back, you understand" Alytica answered.

"Interesting," Gilgamesh murmured. "Fascinating. Perhaps the Narn magic's effects on the soul influenced the Olympification"

"It is known, if used in excess, to damage the body and, potentially, the soul. So it's a good hypothesis" Athena chimed in.

"And you chose to use Narn magic willingly?" Hera asked, out of simple curiosity, her gaze sharp. "Knowing the potential cost to yourself?"

"I chose love," Alytica said simply.

Athena smiled softly at that. Midas drummed his fingers on his armrest, calculations running behind his eyes.

Eventually, Hera raised her hand. "Thank you. Please wait outside while we deliberate."

When Inko returned some time later, she looked amused. "They're going to be talking about this for a while," she said. "You're free to go."

He hesitated. "Can I see him? Now?"

Inko nodded. "Uh, so yeah. That's not usually allowed... but!.." she said with a smile "I happen to know the god handling his onboarding and they'll make an exception."

Another snap. Another shift.

And there, in a glowing hall, Alytica saw Odinn again, next to a god he didn't recognize. His husband looked the same, yet was no longer weary. He was radiant. He was beautiful. He was perfect. He was a god.

The god smiled.
They embraced.

---

Months passed.

Alytica and Odinn. Two Immortal beings, of different types.

They built a new cabin next to a river in the Astral Plane. A new garden and a new home.

They found the mossy stone where they first held hands. Where Alytica so often meditated, and they placed it in the center of the new garden.

Both of them, finally, at peace.
