# Story

## Phase 1: The Burden of Honor

- **Odinn's Spark**: Odinn was born under a rare celestial alignment, marking him as a Sparkbearer—chosen by divine fate. This bestowed upon him extraordinary strength and longevity, but also bound him to a trial. One unique to each Sparkbearer. For Odinn, he learned of his trial at a young age, when his emmisary, a primordial beast named fafnir came to him in a vision. Fafnir told him his trial was the following: live an honorable life, and die an honorable death. From a young age, Odinn was aware of his destiny, and it shaped his every decision. he was a warrior, and he was a king. the most honorable ways to live in narn culture.
he was a legendary warrior, due in part to his spark, but also because of the way he treated others on the battlefield - a warrior with his strength could be a hero and make death defying ventures
but he was contained and took no risks for glory - he tried his best no matter what to bring his men home safe and alive.
- **Narn Culture**: In the Narn culture, honor is the highest virtue. It is defined by leading with strength and dying with dignity. And dying defending a bad claim against your honor is the most honorable death of all. For Odinn, he knew that after he lived his life to the fullest, and set up his kingdom and made his people healthy and happy, that he would need to find challengers. and he would need to die in a duel. a concept that was both a source of pride and a looming shadow over his life
- **The King's Challenge**: As king of a small but prosperous realm, Odinn issued an open challenge to all: any who could defeat him in a duel would inherit his treasures and his throne. This challenge was not just a test of strength but a testament to his commitment to his fate. Many warriors from across the lands came to face him, drawn by the promise of wealth and power. Most gave up mid-fight, some met their end, but none succeeded. Each duel was a reminder of his unfulfilled destiny.

## Phase 2: The Mage's Request

- **Alytica's Arrival and Proposition**: One day, an aging dragonborn mage named Alytica arrived at Odinn's court. Unlike the others, he did not come to duel but to learn. Alytica was a scholar of ancient magics, seeking to understand not only the secrets of Narn magic, but also to learn what he could about the Sparkbearer's time. He made the following proposal: "We both know that I will never defeat you in a duel. I would wager that anyone short of a god would also die. So instead of challenging you to a duel right here and now—I have another challenge, teach me how to kill you—Train me in the ways of Narn magic."
- **Training Bond**: Intrigued by the mage's request, Odinn tentatively agreed, but Narn magic was an extremely difficult art to learn, let alone master. And it was a closely guarded secret among the Narn that they very rarely taught it to outsiders. Odinn said that he would train and spar with him for some time, and if he was worthy, he would teach him the secret magic. Over the following months, they sparred and studied together, forming a bond that transcended mere friendship. Alytica proved himself worthy time and time again. He was not some arrogant scholar as he sometimes first appeared with his fast smile and his quickness to correct others. But instead, he was a humble soul, searching for knowledge and understanding. So Odinn decided to teach him the intricacies of Narn magic, a dangerous and powerful art that could amplify one's abilities but at great personal risk. Through their training, they discovered a mutual respect and admiration for each other's strengths and vulnerabilities.

## Phase 3: Growing Affections

- **Time Alone**: As both were loners by nature, Odinn and Alytica found solace in each other's company. They often traveled to Alytica's cabin in the forests of Noridge—a few days' journey from the kingdom. The cabin was nestled by a serene river, providing a perfect backdrop for their training and reflection.
- **Sparring by the River**: They sparred by the river, their movements fluid and precise, even as the fighting moved over the wet and mossy rocks and the river waters. During one such session, after mostly deflecting a spell from Odinn, Alytica's foot slipped, and he started falling into the river, yelling out in surprise, not wanting to be soaked.
- **A Moment of Connection**: Odinn instinctively grabbed Alytica's hand, pulling him back from the water. They hadn't held hands before, not like that. After Alytica was standing upright, their hands didn't separate. They made eye contact, holding hands, both realizing the feelings they had for each other. Odinn broke the eye and hand contact in slight awkwardness and told Alytica he should watch his footwork.
- **Deepening Bond**: As they spent more time together, their connection deepened. They shared stories of their pasts, their hopes, and their fears. A specific story Alytica told him was about the time, as a boy, Alytica accidentally burned down the local mage academy in his village. Nobody was in the building as he was there after hours and accidentally mixed some ingredients that shouldn't have been mixed, causing a fiery explosion that got out of hand and burned down the building. He told Odinn that's when he learned that there are always consequences to wielding strong magic. That being careful and practiced is important, and mistakes can be deadly—though they could also be fun. When he described the way the people in town looked at this scrawny kid covered in soot and debris and a wide, embarrassed smile, Odinn laughed—a genuine laugh that he hadn't had in ages. With his vast knowledge and gentle wisdom, Alytica became a confidant to Odinn, who found solace in the mage's presence. Slowly, they fell in love, though neither realized it at first. Their bond was a sanctuary from the burdens they each carried, a rare and precious gift in their tumultuous lives.

## Phase 4: Love and the Trial

- **Marriage**: A year later, they wed in a quiet ceremony. Peace, gardens, magic. A moment of joy before the inevitable.
- **Training Incident**: During a particularly intense sparring session, Alytica fails to defend against one of Odinn's powerful strikes. The blow catches him in the chest, shattering several ribs and leaving a large gash on the side of his chest. Odinn immediately drops his weapon, rushing to Alytica's side in panic. The usually stoic giant profusely apologizes as he casts a healing spell to help set the ribs and ease the pain. He carefully carries Alytica to his room to rest. "I shouldn't have hit you so hard," Odinn says dismayed, guilt evident in his voice, his eyes not meeting Alytica's. smiling through the pain, Alytica says "You were perfect—we both know that you will have to go all out in our duel." Odinn's face falls as he confesses, "I'm just... not so sure if I will be able to beat this trial, Alytica"  and they made eye contaact again just like they did when odinn saved him from falling into the river. 
But this time alytica was the one who broke eye contact first - he coughed heavily and placed clutched as his broken ribs in pain. Odinn prepped another healing spell and placed his glowing hands on Alytica's chest

Alytica took in a deep breath as the soothing energy came from odinn's spell and said "I'm sorry, Odinn. I'm sorry you have this burden. It's all well and good, having the strength and long life, and power... But I've always had some sympathy in my heart for sparksbearers. This trial is a cruel one, and I'm sorry you have been handed it" Continueing "but... I'm here now, and I'm not planning on going anywhere - I will help you beat your trial. I promise you, I will help you"

"I care not about that" Odinn said, "I have had many burdens and responsibilities... and I have always been able to handle them. I know I will handle my trial as well - that's not what concerns me.... You are... the best chance I have. But... I'm not sure... I have had this trial in my mind for a long time, and it's never occurred to me that in my duel. In defending my honor and attempting to ascend, that I may fail because I hold myself back... It's just... I'm not sure I can do it... I hate hurting you, Alytica"

Alytica rested his hand on Odinn's which has healing him. He looked him in the eyes and said "I'm not going to lie to you, Odinn. I'm not sure you can do this. I'm not sure I can do this. But... I will be there with you. And no matter what happens, I will be there. You won't be alone. I promise you that."

Alytica pulled odins hand off his and sheepishly chest and kissed it, before putting it back on his chest.

Odinn stopped the spell and looked at Alytica. "The river... This... There is something between us. What it is, I don't know, but I appreciate you being with me, and I will do my best by you now matter what. No matter what you want I will be here for you"

Odinn then hugged Alytica and kissed him on the forehead. "Thank you for everything you have done for me, Alytica"

"I will leave you to rest now." odinn said, standing up "I will send my best healer to help you with your ribs. And send in your favorite food. I will see you tomorrow"

Alytica nodded and said "Thank you, Odinn. I will see you tomorrow"

Odinn left the room and the healer and food arrived shortly after


The next day, Alytica was feeling much better, and they spent the day together, training and talking about their lives.

During training, Alytica kept pushing himself to the limit, and odinn kept pushing back. Alytica was getting better, but odinn was still his superior.

After their lunch, Alytica asked odinn to go all out, and odinn solumnly stood and obliged.
Alytica was able to hold his own, and even land a few blows, but he was still not yet a match for odinn.

Odinn was impressed, and he knew Alytica was getting better. He knew Alytica was a true sparring partner, He respected him more than ever.

Odinn Landed a few blows, but Alytica blocked most, and then odinn found an opening and sent a powerful punch directly to Alytica's chest wound - he stopped his punch just before it its target

Alytica froze, with an artifically exasperated sigh

"I win" odinn said with a smile

Alytica smiled back and grabbed odinn's hand and slowly he pulled him in for a hug.

Odinn hugged him back, and they stood there for a time, just enjoying the moment.

Alytica then pulled odinn in for a kiss.

Odinn kissed him back.

the kiss broke, and odinn broke the silence first.

"I love you" odinn said

"I love you too" Alytica said

They kissed again

The two would spend the rest of the day together resting and talking about their lives.

From that day on, they stayed in Odins quarters at night, and spent the days together, continuing their training as their bond grew deeper.

They took a trip to Alytica's cabin, a few weeks later.

And odinn brought him down to the river, and put him on the rock where they first touched hands, and he said 
"We have spent a lot of time together, and learned together and trained together. We have loved together and cried together. It has only been a few months, but I want to spend the rest of my life with you. and i want you to be my husband. Would you marry me?"

Alytica smiled - "You know? I very much didn't expect this would be the outcome when I brought you my challenge" and he and odinn softly laughed togehter, "but I am enourmously glad it is - I love you, and I it would be an honor to be your husband"

and they were married in a small ceremony in the cabin. a few months later


- **Anniversary Betrayal**: A year past, and Alytica grew stronger, they lived their lives with this contant knowledge that one day their duel would occur. Alytica was a little more confident, but odinn was still an incredbly powerful opponent in battle - And there was a growing discomfort concen between them that Odinn might just be too strong. Alytica found his husband staring into space some times and he knew he was worried that nobody would be stronger than him. They traveled on the anniversary of their wedding. For a meal at Alytica's now a common location to find them. Odinn was king, but he selected very suitible staff and the kingdom didn't truly need him to operate. At the cabin, Alytica cooked a feast for Odinn  and  poisoned— him subtly, spiritually. A slow Feywild flower toxin that weakens the soul.
- **The Challenge**: Alytica insults Odinn's honor, triggering the duel. It's heart-wrenching but necessary—Alytica is saving Odinn from becoming a Titan.

## Phase 5: The Final Duel

- **River Duel**: They duel by the river where Odinn proposed. Odinn, weakened but proud, fights with full force.
- **Revelation and Pain**: Odinn realizes he was poisoned. Alytica confesses: "Your trial never required an honorable opponent, my love."
- **The Last Blow**: After an epic clash, Alytica kills Odinn. His body vanishes in a flash of white—he has ascended.
- Olympification: Due to the soul-depleting effects of Narn magic, Alytica's physical body is Olympified—invincible, eternal, still himself.

## Phase 6: Divine Observation

- **Divine Observation**: The Demeran pantheon watched the fight go down, as it is the duty of the pantheon to observe divine trials to prevent any cheating done by the gods (a thing that has been banned for millennia in the Pact of Olympus).
- **Inkozana's Witness**: A god named Inkozana (though she asks to go by Inko) sees that the Narn succeeded his trial. She isn't one of the most powerful gods, neither in worship nor political power in the Olympic councils, but she does her job, enjoys it, and finds it rewarding though sometimes saddening.
- **Record Keeper**: Inko keeps records of the Sparkbearers' lives and sends reports to the council whenever a trial ends, in success or failure (though the god onboarding team will be aware first). She thinks her job is done, and she will monitor the next Sparkbearer when they are born.
- **Unexpected Discovery**: When noting what item became Olympic, she realized with astonishment that it was Alytica, due to his profound magical presence. This had never happened before.
- **Council Interruption**: She alerts heads to Olympus and walks into the divine council who are having a hearing on procedural matters related to import laws into Olympia. She interrupts and says something new happened. She explains Odinn and Alytica had battled, and Odinn is getting onboarded. Apollo (an arrogant bastard in Inko's estimation) says that's not really worth interrupting. She drops the bomb that *Alytica* was the Olympic item.

## Phase 7: Alytica's Transformation

- **Pride and Joy**: Back when he sees his husband ascend, Alytica feels pride and joy, and a tear falls from his eyes as he has saved his love.
- **Divine Energy**: He then feels something more - a deep powerful energy in his entire body - something old, something powerful - more powerful than he has ever experienced.
- **Painful Transition**: Suddenly, pain - fire in his veins. He looks at his hands and sees his scales are glowing white - he feels like he's dying.
- **Power Surge**: But the pain leaves, shuts off like a switch. The power remains though - he can see only white as he fully glows with the divine.
- **Healing**: Then, the power runs back down, but still, he feels incredible - he feels his wounds close up, his tired soul be healed. His vision comes back as his glowing fades.
- **Realization**: He sees nothing left of his husband, not his belt, not his armor. He expects an Olympic item, but there is none. He puts two and two together and realizes that... it's impossible, but it's the only thing that makes sense.
- **New Strength**: He stands and looks over the destruction of their fight. He feels stronger than ever - isn't sleepy, isn't tired.
- **Testing Powers**: He feels his magic is stronger and attempts to cast some simple spell to feel out his current status. It emerges with wholly unexpected force, about 3 times what he meant.
- **Emotional Processing**: He is somewhat shocked, and sits and walks over to the river. He has had a long day, and while not tired physically (anymore), he was emotionally exhausted.
- **Thoughts of Odinn**: He spared a thought to his husband who was now being onboarded by the other gods. His husband, a god, he thinks to himself.
- **Prayer and Meditation**: He doesn't believe he will receive it, but sends a quick prayer of love to his husband. He sits by the river and meditates to help with the emotions and wait for his husband to reach out.

## Phase 7: Divine Intervention
- Alytica felt a strong wind around him that broke him out of his meditation. he opened his eyes and saw a god standing before him. She introduced herself as Inkozana, and said that something new happened. She explained that Odinn had ascended, but that the olympic item wasn't created like normal. She explained that Alytica *was* the Olympic item.
- Alytica said he already knew that, but asked how Inozana knew. She explained that she had been watching the fight, and she had wathced his husband ascend. She was a little offput by his calm demeanor, though during her documentation of odinns story, she wasn't entirely shocked
- She explained that she was here to pick him up and take him to the divine council. They had questions for him.
- He asked if he would be able to see his husband, she said yes, after the councils questioning. She reassured him that it wasn't anything bad and he wasn't in danger or trouble, they just wanted to know more about the situation and circumstances and how a mortal could become an olympic item.
- He agreed to go, and they left for the divine council. Inkozana snapped her fingers and they were in a room with a long table and 8 chairs All facing toward him -  5 were occupied by various gods, and 3 were empty
- a seat was available for him in the middle of the room for questioning he presumed, and he sat down at the empty chair. in the middle of the room
- Inko Introduced him to the gods, as he sat down. and he was asked to tell his story. and she sat off to the side.
- He told them about the trial and his relationship with Odinn, and how he ascended, and the use of narn magic and the feywild flower.
- The gods asked about the flower and how long he had used the narn magic during the fight - he said he didn't know, but it was a lot.
- They asked more questions, and he answered them to the best of his ability.
- He was asked to leave the room, and the gods conferred.
- Inko came back and said that they will probably be talking and studying this even for a long time - and that he was free to go home if he wanted
- but he asked if instead he could to go to the onboarding room to see his husband.
- Inko said that was not normally allowed, but she knows the person onboarding Odinn and that they would be fine with it, and snapped her fingers and they were in the onboarding room.
- He saw his husband there, and they embraced.

## Phase 8: Aftermath and Apotheosis
- **New Beginning**: Together again, they build a new cabin and garden beside a river in the Astral Plane. God and immortal, forever.

# The Story of Odinn and Alytica  

Odinn was born in a humble village in the far south of Narnlund - He was born with a special kind of soul - one double-kissed by the divine. He was  Sparkbearer — a soul with a divine spark which Odinn was weighted to bare. The spark gave him immense strength, longevity, and a destiny that was not his to refuse. The Spark was both gift and curse, for it came with a trial—one unique to each bearer. On the eve of his 16th year, he received his trial in a vision, when the primordial dragon Fafnir appeared before him and spoke only a single Phrase that would live in his mind for the rest of his life: *Your trial: "Live an honorable life, and die an honorable death."* From that moment, the path of his life was set in stone.

As a member of giant race, the narn, Odinn’s honor was already bound to the strict codes of his people. To lead with strength and to die defending one’s name—these were the highest virtues. He became a king early in his life, and though he possessed great might, he never sought glory or conquest. He was a warrior, yes, but not for pride. He led with caution, with wisdom, and with a fierce desire to bring his people home from every battle. Each choice he made, each war he waged, was guided by his trial.

Eventually, with his realm prosperous and his people content, Odinn knew the time was drawing near. He could not simply pass in his sleep. His trial demanded an end worthy of his legacy. And so, as was custom in Narn culture, he issued the ancient challenge: a public invitation to all—any who could defeat him in single combat would claim the treasures Odinn had collected throughout his life, and unknowingly, his role in the fulfillment of a divine promise.

Decades passed with the challenge open. Many answered answered the challenge. None succeeded. Some challengers died. Most left humbled. And the weight of an unfinished trial continued to press upon the king's broad shoulders. 

---

Then came Alytica.

He arrived not with sword drawn, but with scrolls tucked under his arm. An aging dragonborn with striking eyes and a sharp wit, Alytica made no attempt to hide the absurdity of his request. He stood before the throne, bowed only half-seriously, and said:

> “We both know as of now, I couldn't defeat you in a duel, King Odinn. I doubt anyone short of a god could walz in here and take you on. So rather than waste both our time with a fight right now. I have a better offer. Train me. Teach me in Narn magic. Teach me how to kill you.”

Silence fell in the court. And Odinn, curious despite himself, agreed with a stipulation.

> "I can teach narn magic, but it is a dangerous, and it is not something I will teach just anyone. I will train you, and evaluate you - if you impress me, I will teach you. If you do not, you will leave here with nothing more than a bruise or two."

Alytica bowed and smiled and said 

> "I understand, and thank you for the chance. I will aim not to disappoint you - and perhaps, if I am lucky, you get a bruise or two as well"

At first, it was simply sparring and philosophy. Though Alytica was already a skilled fighter, Odinn pushed him far beyond his limits, showing him techniques that would challenge even seasoned warriors. The battlemage met each new challenge with determination, but there was something different about him. Beneath his fast smile and sharp tongue was a soul searching for something—truth, perhaps, or maybe redemption.

For weeks, Alytica trained in basic combat and sparring, never once mentioning Narn magic again. But Odinn saw how the dragonborn's eyes would linger on his demonstrations, studying every movement with keen interest. Finally, after proving his dedication through countless bruising sessions, Odinn decided to broach the subject himself.

Narn magic, Odinn explained, was no mere tool. It was a sacred technique—one that bound the soul to the bloodstream, igniting divine energy within the body. Dangerous, taxing, and rarely taught to outsiders. But Alytica proved himself worthy, not just through strength or intellect, but through persistence. He returned to the training grounds each day bruised, bloodied, and grinning.

Odinn watched him grow—not only stronger, but closer.

---

The cabin was in Northern Noridge, nestled beside a quiet river, snuggled among the trees and home to alytica's garden. It became their retreat. Far from the demands of kingship and study, it was here that their bond quietly transformed.

Despite their differences in size, power, and origin, Odinn and Alytica found in each other a rare and unexpected kind of kinship. Both loners by nature, they slipped into quiet companionship with ease. When courtly duties allowed, Odinn would travel with Alytica to a secluded cabin in the forests of Noridge—a humble wooden home nestled beside a peaceful river.

There, surrounded by the whispering trees and running water, they trained and spoke.
Alytica tended to the garden, where he grew herbs and vegetables, and magical plants for his spells and potions

Odinn would hunt the woods for food, and they would cook together.

Sparring matches became a daily ritual, their movements fluid, synchronized. On one such day, a blast of deflected energy sent Alytica slipping on the moss-slick rocks near the river’s edge.

He yelped as he stumbled, arms flailing

Odinn caught him instinctively, his massive hand closing around Alytica’s wrist and pulling him back to solid ground. They stood still, close. Their hands didn’t separate. For a moment, neither spoke.

Their eyes met.

Odinn was the first to look away. “You should watch your footwork,” he said, gently, releasing his grip.

But something unspoken had passed between them—something both of them recognized but neither yet named.

In the days that followed, they shared more than just technique. They spoke of the past, of mistakes and memories. Alytica told Odinn the story of how, as a boy, he had accidentally burned down his village’s mage academy. No one had been inside at the time—he had snuck in alone, after hours, mixing potions out of pure curiosity. The resulting explosion had blackened the sky and reduced the building to rubble. He recalled standing in the smoking ruins, soot-stained, grinning sheepishly as the townsfolk gathered to stare.

“I learned that day,” he said with a chuckle, “that powerful magic doesn’t forgive carelessness. Though I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t a little fun.”

Odinn laughed—a deep, genuine laugh that startled even him. It had been a long time since he’d laughed like that.

That moment, and others like it, slowly wove something deeper between them. They grew close, without fully realizing how close. Their bond became something warm and unspoken—a place of comfort untouched by trials or prophecy. It was not yet love, not exactly. But it was close enough to recognize the shape it would take.

---

A few weeks later, during one particularly intense sparring session, Alytica misjudged Odinn’s momentum. A heavy blow slammed into his chest, shattering ribs and tearing muscle. He fell hard, breath gone, pain blooming like fire through his side.

Odinn dropped everything and rushed to him, panic in his voice, his healing magic already glowing around his hands. "I misjudged my blow, I'm sorry”

Alytica coughed, smiling weakly. “You were perfect. We both know you’ll have to go all out.”

Odinn sat back on his heels, worry heavy in his chest. “I don’t know if I can do this. I’ve spent my whole life preparing for this trial. But I never imagined...”

Alytica placed a hand over Odinn’s as healing light seeped into his skin. “I won’t lie. I’m not sure either of us can do this. But I’ll be there. You won’t face this alone.”

"No, I'm not concerned about that" odinn said "I've carried burdens and responsibilities for a long time, and I've learned to bear them. I'm more concerned about... In the moment, in the end. I don't know if I will be able to force myself to give everything I have to the fight... I just... I hate hurting you. You've never shown me anything but kindness and respect. I just... I don't want to hurt you"

Alytica gave a faint smile - He kissed the back of Odinn’s hand and laid it back over his chest. Odinn's voice was low when he answered.

“The river. That moment. This... there’s something between us. I don’t know what it means yet, but I know I want to be beside you. No matter what happens.”

Alytica smiled. “Then stay. And we’ll find a way together.”

Odinn hugged him gently, kissed his forehead, and whispered, “Thank you for everything you’ve done for me.”

“I’ll see you tomorrow,” Alytica said, already drifting into sleep as the healer was summoned.

---

The next day, they trained again. Harder. Closer.

Alytica pushed himself to the edge. Odinn pushed back. Though Alytica was improving fast—sharp, agile, inventive—he still couldn’t overpower Odinn. Not yet.

After lunch, Alytica asked Odinn to fight at full strength. No holding back.

Odinn agreed, solemn as a storm. The duel that followed was breathtaking. Fire met steel, spell met spell. Alytica held his own, even landed a few hits. But Odinn remained faster, stronger.

In the final clash, Odinn found an opening and drew back a devastating punch aimed at Alytica’s chest—the same place he’d injured before. But just before contact, he stopped. Inches away.

“I win,” he said with a grin.

Alytica sighed dramatically, then laughed. He grabbed Odinn’s hand and pulled him into a hug.

They savored the moment, and then they looked at each other, the same look, the same feelings in their eyes.

Then, slowly, Alytica kissed him.

Odinn kissed him back.

“I love you,” Odinn said.

“I love you too,” Alytica replied.

From that moment on, they no longer returned to separate chambers. They trained together by day, slept in each other’s arms by night.

A few weeks later, Odinn brought Alytica to the river, to the same mossy stone where they had once first held hands.

“We’ve fought together, grown together, laughed and hurt and healed,” Odinn said. “It’s only been months, but I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Will you marry me?”

Alytica smiled. “When I came to you, I didn’t think this was how the story would end. But gods, I’m glad it did. I love you. It would be an honor.”

They were married in the cabin that evening, alone in the woods, there was no crowning, no court, no priestly blessing. though that would come in time. Instead they where happy with hands held and promises made. It was peace, carved out from the storm of their fates.

---

Their anniversary should have been peaceful.

A year had passed since their marriage, and their bond had only deepened. Alytica had grown stronger—faster in combat, more precise with his spells. Yet even as he improved, the distance between them in sheer power remained daunting. Odinn was still a Sparkbearer, still a Narn. Still, perhaps, too strong.

Alytica noticed his husband growing quieter. He would catch him staring into space during training, lost in thought. He didn’t need to ask what weighed on him. They both knew—the trial was still unfulfilled, and though Alytica was still imporving, he was not yet strong enough to defeat his husband in combat and might never be.

So, several weeks before their anniversary, Alytica made a choice.

The Narn, as chilren get sick and are suscepitble to poisons, but as adults they are known for being immune to both.

And yet, Alytica had heard of a flower that would be a poison, not to the body, but to the soul.

He recently found an excuse to go on a trip to the Feywild, where he had traded a rare and powerful artifact for some seeds

Which he planted in his garden. He dried the flowers and crushed them.

And for their anniversary, meal had it woven into the seasoning of their of odinns favorite dish.

It's not a poison that would kill Odinn, but it would be a poison that would sap his soul, dimming his divine spark just enough to tilt the coming duel in Alytica’s favor. One that his narn immunity would not protect him from.

They returned to the cabin in Noridge. Odinn, though king, had appointed trustworthy stewards and rarely needed to govern directly. The cabin had become their refuge. 

That night, Alytica cooked them a feast for their anniversary. It was rich, aromatic, full of familiar flavors—and subtly laced with the soulblight extract of a rare Feywild flower.

The toxin wouldn’t kill Odinn. It wouldn’t even make him ill. It would do something far more specific: it would sap the strength of his soul, dimming his divine spark just enough to tilt the coming duel in Alytica’s favor.

Odinn suspected nothing—until Alytica insulted him.

He stood after dinner and spoke sharp words, calling Odinn a coward, a selfish king, a man hiding behind his power. In Narn culture, such accusations could not be ignored. They were a challenge, plain and unmissable.

Odinn didn’t respond. He stood quietly, face unreadable. They walked together out of the cabin, past the gardens Alytica had tended that morning, and down to the river—the same spot where Odinn had once proposed.

There, the duel began.

At first, Odinn fought cautiously, unsure of Alytica’s intentions. Alytica responded with restraint—shields, dodges, deflections—stalling. Watching.

Then the storm broke.

Alytica unleashed his full strength. Plasma magic lit the sky in burning arcs, crashing into the earth like thunder. He moved like fire given form, a whirlwind of elemental precision. Odinn blocked, countered, pushed back—but something was wrong.

He was slow.

His limbs felt heavy, his vision blurred at the edges. When he called on his divine magic, it faltered. He felt… sick.

A sensation he hadn’t known since childhood.

And then he remembered. The flower. The one Alytica mentioned once in passing, said to sap the soul itself. The same flower he’d seen that morning in the garden. The same one woven into the seasoning of their meal.

He looked across the battlefield, eyes wide with understanding.

“You poisoned me,” he said.

Alytica, bruised and panting, met his gaze. “Your trial never required an honorable opponent, my love.”

They fought on.

Even diminished, Odinn was a titan in combat. Every strike shook the riverbed, every roar of magic scorched the trees. The duel was mythic—lightning in the skies, fire in the earth. The cabin burned. The garden was ash. The river swelled with power.

But Alytica was no longer just a scholar. He was a weapon Odinn had forged with his own hands. And in the end, he was enough.

Odinn fell, not in failure, but in fulfillment.

He smiled as he collapsed, the last light of his divine spark flaring white-hot. His body vanished in a brilliant flash, ascension finally complete.

A god was born.

And Alytica stood alone at the riverside, weeping through a smile, knowing he had both slain and saved the man he loved.

Far above the mortal realm, nestled in the gleaming halls of the Demeran pantheon, the gods watched.

They always watched when a Sparkbearer's trial approached its end. It was tradition, yes—but also law. The Pact of Olympus, signed millennia ago, forbade divine interference in mortal trials. Observation was permitted. Cheating was not.

Among the gods seated in quiet vigilance was Inkozana, though she preferred to go by Inko. She was not a mighty war goddess or high judge of cosmic law—her following was modest, her political sway middling. But she had a job, and she performed it with care.

Inko was the keeper of Sparkbearer records. It was her duty to document their lives, track their progress, and file formal reports upon the conclusion of each trial. She had watched Odinn’s life unfold like the slow turning of a great wheel—each step heavy with meaning, every choice carved by prophecy.

When the final duel ended and Odinn's body vanished in a flash of white, she made a quiet note in her scroll.

Trial complete. Ascension successful.

She prepared to turn her attention to the next Sparkbearer, not yet born.

Then she noticed something strange.

Each ascension left behind a relic: the Olympic item, an object dear to the newly ascended that absorbed a portion of their divine power. But there was no item. No sword, no cloak, no pendant.

Instead, there was a presence. A powerful one. Still mortal… and yet not.

Alytica.

Inko blinked, then blinked again.

“Oh,” she whispered to herself. “Oh, that’s new.”

Without delay, she gathered her records and marched to the divine council chambers, where a hearing on import laws into Olympia was dragging on with divine slowness. She pushed open the doors.

“I have something more important.”

Apollo—resplendent, smug—barely glanced up. “Unless it’s a new pantheon collapsing, I’d rather not—”

“Odinn completed his trial,” she interrupted.

He sighed. “Yes, yes. Another god joins the roster. We’ll send a fruit basket.”

Inko smirked. “The Olympic item was a person. Alytica.”

Silence.

Then chaos.

---

At the riverside, Alytica stood alone.

He looked out over the ruined garden, the scorched trees, the ashes of their home. And in that stillness, he felt something bloom inside him.

At first, it was pride. He had done it. He had fulfilled the impossible. He had saved Odinn from the fate of a Titan. A tear slipped down his cheek.

Then, the energy came.

It surged through him like lightning caught in blood. His veins burned. His vision whited out. He stumbled to his knees, gasping as his scales glowed brighter than fire. His breath came shallow, as though something vast and ancient was crawling into his soul.

Pain, then silence.

Then… power.

The pain vanished as swiftly as it had come, but the power remained. He opened his eyes—restored. His body was whole, his wounds closed. He felt not exhaustion, but vitality. His soul hummed with something divine.

He looked down at his hands.

They glowed faintly, just at the edges.

Around him, the world was still. Odinn’s body was gone. No armor. No sword. No relic.

Only Alytica remained.

He sat by the river, processing the impossible. He tried casting a simple spell—just a flicker of light—and it exploded in his hand, three times stronger than intended.

“Right,” he muttered to himself, blinking at the afterimage. “So that’s happening.”

He closed his eyes and took a long, deep breath.

His husband was a god now. He knew it in his bones. And something within him had changed as well. He was not dead. He was not an item. He was… more.

He sent up a quiet prayer.

Not because he thought it would be heard. But because it felt right.

“I love you,” he whispered to the wind. “Wherever you are.”

And then the wind answered.

---

some time later, a sudden gust swept through the ruined clearing. Alytica’s eyes opened as a figure appeared—calm, composed, and slightly awkward in posture.

“Hi,” she said, brushing windblown hair from her face. “Um, hi.I’m Inkozana. you can call me Inko.”

Alytica didn’t move. “You’re a god.”

“uh yeah,I am. And I’m here because something very strange just happened.” She paused. “Your husband ascended, which, congratulations. But you… you became the Olympic item.”

Alytica tilted his head. “I figured. Kind of hard to miss.”

Inko smiled faintly. “That’s… not supposed to be possible.”

“I have a tendency to ruin well-established systems,” he said dryly.

She laughed. “That’s why the divine council wants to speak with you.”

Alytica asked only one thing: “Will I get to see him?”

“After the hearing. I promise.”

With a snap of her fingers, they vanished.

---

They reappeared in a vast, formal chamber. Eight chairs stood in a semicircle. Five were filled. Alytica recognized none of the gods seated, but all of them looked at him with curiosity.

Inko led him to a single chair in the center of the room and introduced him.

Then they began.

He told them everything: the trial, the training, the love. The Feywild flower. The Narn magic. The decision. The duel.

They asked questions—technical, theological, even emotional. He answered as best he could.

Eventually, he was asked to step out while they conferred.

When Inko returned, she looked amused. “They’re going to be talking about this for a while,” she said. “You’re free to go.”

He hesitated. “Can I see him? Now?”

Inko nodded. “I know the god doing his onboarding. They’ll be fine with it.”

Another snap. Another shift.

And there, in a glowing hall beyond mortal understanding, Alytica saw Odinn again.

The god smiled.

They embraced.
