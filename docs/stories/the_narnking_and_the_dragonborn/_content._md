# Odinn and Alytica - Story Structure

## Phase 1: The Burden of Honor

- **Odinn's Spark**: Odinn was born under a rare celestial alignment, marking him as a Sparkbearer—chosen by divine fate. This bestowed upon him extraordinary strength and longevity, but also bound him to a trial. One unique to each Sparkbearer. For Odinn, he learned of his trial at a young age, when his emmisary, a primordial beast named fafnir came to him in a vision. Fafnir told him his trial was the following: live an honorable life, and die an honorable death. From a young age, Odinn was aware of his destiny, and it shaped his every decision. he was a warrior, and he was a king. the most honorable ways to live in narn culture.
he was a legendary warrior, due in part to his spark, but also because of the way he treated others on the battlefield - a warrior with his strength could be a hero and make death defying ventures
but he was contained and took no risks for glory - he tried his best no matter what to bring his men home safe and alive.
- **Narn Culture**: In the Narn culture, honor is the highest virtue. It is defined by leading with strength and dying with dignity. And dying defending a bad claim against your honor is the most honorable death of all. For Odinn, he knew that after he lived his life to the fullest, and set up his kingdom and made his people healthy and happy, that he would need to find challengers. and he would need to die in a duel. a concept that was both a source of pride and a looming shadow over his life
- **The King's Challenge**: As king of a small but prosperous realm, Odinn issued an open challenge to all: any who could defeat him in a duel would inherit his treasures and his throne. This challenge was not just a test of strength but a testament to his commitment to his fate. Many warriors from across the lands came to face him, drawn by the promise of wealth and power. Most gave up mid-fight, some met their end, but none succeeded. Each duel was a reminder of his unfulfilled destiny.

## Phase 2: The Mage's Request

- **Alytica's Arrival and Proposition**: One day, an aging dragonborn mage named Alytica arrived at Odinn's court. Unlike the others, he did not come to duel but to learn. Alytica was a scholar of ancient magics, seeking to understand not only the secrets of Narn magic, but also to learn what he could about the Sparkbearer's time. He made the following proposal: "We both know that I will never defeat you in a duel. I would wager that anyone short of a god would also die. So instead of challenging you to a duel right here and now—I have another challenge, teach me how to kill you—Train me in the ways of Narn magic."
- **Training Bond**: Intrigued by the mage's request, Odinn tentatively agreed, but Narn magic was an extremely difficult art to learn, let alone master. And it was a closely guarded secret among the Narn that they very rarely taught it to outsiders. Odinn said that he would train and spar with him for some time, and if he was worthy, he would teach him the secret magic. Over the following months, they sparred and studied together, forming a bond that transcended mere friendship. Alytica proved himself worthy time and time again. He was not some arrogant scholar as he sometimes first appeared with his fast smile and his quickness to correct others. But instead, he was a humble soul, searching for knowledge and understanding. So Odinn decided to teach him the intricacies of Narn magic, a dangerous and powerful art that could amplify one's abilities but at great personal risk. Through their training, they discovered a mutual respect and admiration for each other's strengths and vulnerabilities.

## Phase 3: Growing Affections

- **Time Alone**: As both were loners by nature, Odinn and Alytica found solace in each other's company. They often traveled to Alytica's cabin in the forests of Noridge—a few days' journey from the kingdom. The cabin was nestled by a serene river, providing a perfect backdrop for their training and reflection.
- **Sparring by the River**: They sparred by the river, their movements fluid and precise, even as the fighting moved over the wet and mossy rocks and the river waters. During one such session, after mostly deflecting a spell from Odinn, Alytica's foot slipped, and he started falling into the river, yelling out in surprise, not wanting to be soaked.
- **A Moment of Connection**: Odinn instinctively grabbed Alytica's hand, pulling him back from the water. They hadn't held hands before, not like that. After Alytica was standing upright, their hands didn't separate. They made eye contact, holding hands, both realizing the feelings they had for each other. Odinn broke the eye and hand contact in slight awkwardness and told Alytica he should watch his footwork.
- **Deepening Bond**: As they spent more time together, their connection deepened. They shared stories of their pasts, their hopes, and their fears. A specific story Alytica told him was about the time, as a boy, Alytica accidentally burned down the local mage academy in his village. Nobody was in the building as he was there after hours and accidentally mixed some ingredients that shouldn't have been mixed, causing a fiery explosion that got out of hand and burned down the building. He told Odinn that's when he learned that there are always consequences to wielding strong magic. That being careful and practiced is important, and mistakes can be deadly—though they could also be fun. When he described the way the people in town looked at this scrawny kid covered in soot and debris and a wide, embarrassed smile, Odinn laughed—a genuine laugh that he hadn't had in ages. With his vast knowledge and gentle wisdom, Alytica became a confidant to Odinn, who found solace in the mage's presence. Slowly, they fell in love, though neither realized it at first. Their bond was a sanctuary from the burdens they each carried, a rare and precious gift in their tumultuous lives.

## Phase 4: Love and the Trial

- **Marriage**: A year later, they wed in a quiet ceremony. Peace, gardens, magic. A moment of joy before the inevitable.
- **Training Incident**: During a particularly intense sparring session, Alytica fails to defend against one of Odinn's powerful strikes. The blow catches him in the chest, shattering several ribs and leaving a large gash on the side of his chest. Odinn immediately drops his weapon, rushing to Alytica's side in panic. The usually stoic giant profusely apologizes as he casts a healing spell to help set the ribs and ease the pain. He carefully carries Alytica to his room to rest. "I shouldn't have hit you so hard," Odinn says dismayed, guilt evident in his voice, his eyes not meeting Alytica's. smiling through the pain, Alytica says "You were perfect—we both know that you will have to go all out in our duel." Odinn's face falls as he confesses, "I'm just... not so sure if I will be able to beat this trial, Alytica"  and they made eye contaact again just like they did when odinn saved him from falling into the river. 
But this time alytica was the one who broke eye contact first - he coughed heavily and placed clutched as his broken ribs in pain. Odinn prepped another healing spell and placed his glowing hands on Alytica's chest

Alytica took in a deep breath as the soothing energy came from odinn's spell and said "I'm sorry, Odinn. I'm sorry you have this burden. It's all well and good, having the strength and long life, and power... But I've always had some sympathy in my heart for sparksbearers. This trial is a cruel one, and I'm sorry you have been handed it" Continueing "but... I'm here now, and I'm not planning on going anywhere - I will help you beat your trial. I promise you, I will help you"

"I care not about that" Odinn said, "I have had many burdens and responsibilities... and I have always been able to handle them. I know I will handle my trial as well - that's not what concerns me.... You are... the best chance I have. But... I'm not sure... I have had this trial in my mind for a long time, and it's never occurred to me that in my duel. In defending my honor and attempting to ascend, that I may fail because I hold myself back... It's just... I'm not sure I can do it... I hate hurting you, Alytica"

Alytica rested his hand on Odinn's which has healing him. He looked him in the eyes and said "I'm not going to lie to you, Odinn. I'm not sure you can do this. I'm not sure I can do this. But... I will be there with you. And no matter what happens, I will be there. You won't be alone. I promise you that."

Alytica pulled odins hand off his and sheepishly chest and kissed it, before putting it back on his chest.

Odinn stopped the spell and looked at Alytica. "The river... This... There is something between us. What it is, I don't know, but I appreciate you being with me, and I will do my best by you now matter what. No matter what you want I will be here for you"

Odinn then hugged Alytica and kissed him on the forehead. "Thank you for everything you have done for me, Alytica"

"I will leave you to rest now." odinn said, standing up "I will send my best healer to help you with your ribs. And send in your favorite food. I will see you tomorrow"

Alytica nodded and said "Thank you, Odinn. I will see you tomorrow"

Odinn left the room and the healer and food arrived shortly after


The next day, Alytica was feeling much better, and they spent the day together, training and talking about their lives.

During training, Alytica kept pushing himself to the limit, and odinn kept pushing back. Alytica was getting better, but odinn was still his superior.

After their lunch, Alytica asked odinn to go all out, and odinn solumnly stood and obliged.
Alytica was able to hold his own, and even land a few blows, but he was still not yet a match for odinn.

Odinn was impressed, and he knew Alytica was getting better. He knew Alytica was a true sparring partner, He respected him more than ever.

Odinn Landed a few blows, but Alytica blocked most, and then odinn found an opening and sent a powerful punch directly to Alytica's chest wound - he stopped his punch just before it its target

Alytica froze, with an artifically exasperated sigh

"I win" odinn said with a smile

Alytica smiled back and grabbed odinn's hand and slowly he pulled him in for a hug.

Odinn hugged him back, and they stood there for a time, just enjoying the moment.

Alytica then pulled odinn in for a kiss.

Odinn kissed him back.

the kiss broke, and odinn broke the silence first.

"I love you" odinn said

"I love you too" Alytica said

They kissed again

The two would spend the rest of the day together resting and talking about their lives.

From that day on, they stayed in Odins quarters at night, and spent the days together, continuing their training as their bond grew deeper.

They took a trip to Alytica's cabin, a few weeks later.

And odinn brought him down to the river, and put him on the rock where they first touched hands, and he said 
"We have spent a lot of time together, and learned together and trained together. We have loved together and cried together. It has only been a few months, but I want to spend the rest of my life with you. and i want you to be my husband. Would you marry me?"

Alytica smiled - "You know? I very much didn't expect this would be the outcome when I brought you my challenge" and he and odinn softly laughed togehter, "but I am enourmously glad it is - I love you, and I it would be an honor to be your husband"

and they were married in a small ceremony in the cabin. a few months later


- **Anniversary Betrayal**: A year past, and Alytica grew stronger, they lived their lives with this contant knowledge that one day their duel would occur. Alytica was a little more confident, but odinn was still an incredbly powerful opponent in battle - And there was a growing discomfort concen between them that Odinn might just be too strong. Alytica found his husband staring into space some times and he knew he was worried that nobody would be stronger than him. They traveled on the anniversary of their wedding. For a meal at Alytica's now a common location to find them. Odinn was king, but he selected very suitible staff and the kingdom didn't truly need him to operate. At the cabin, Alytica cooked a feast for Odinn  and  poisoned— him subtly, spiritually. A slow Feywild flower toxin that weakens the soul.
- **The Challenge**: Alytica insults Odinn's honor, triggering the duel. It's heart-wrenching but necessary—Alytica is saving Odinn from becoming a Titan.

## Phase 5: The Final Duel

- **River Duel**: They duel by the river where Odinn proposed. Odinn, weakened but proud, fights with full force.
- **Revelation and Pain**: Odinn realizes he was poisoned. Alytica confesses: "Your trial never required an honorable opponent, my love."
- **The Last Blow**: After an epic clash, Alytica kills Odinn. His body vanishes in a flash of white—he has ascended.
- Olympification: Due to the soul-depleting effects of Narn magic, Alytica's physical body is Olympified—invincible, eternal, still himself.

## Phase 6: Divine Observation

- **Divine Observation**: The Demeran pantheon watched the fight go down, as it is the duty of the pantheon to observe divine trials to prevent any cheating done by the gods (a thing that has been banned for millennia in the Pact of Olympus).
- **Inkozana's Witness**: A god named Inkozana (though she asks to go by Inko) sees that the Narn succeeded his trial. She isn't one of the most powerful gods, neither in worship nor political power in the Olympic councils, but she does her job, enjoys it, and finds it rewarding though sometimes saddening.
- **Record Keeper**: Inko keeps records of the Sparkbearers' lives and sends reports to the council whenever a trial ends, in success or failure (though the god onboarding team will be aware first). She thinks her job is done, and she will monitor the next Sparkbearer when they are born.
- **Unexpected Discovery**: When noting what item became Olympic, she realized with astonishment that it was Alytica, due to his profound magical presence. This had never happened before.
- **Council Interruption**: She alerts heads to Olympus and walks into the divine council who are having a hearing on procedural matters related to import laws into Olympia. She interrupts and says something new happened. She explains Odinn and Alytica had battled, and Odinn is getting onboarded. Apollo (an arrogant bastard in Inko's estimation) says that's not really worth interrupting. She drops the bomb that *Alytica* was the Olympic item.

## Phase 7: Alytica's Transformation

- **Pride and Joy**: Back when he sees his husband ascend, Alytica feels pride and joy, and a tear falls from his eyes as he has saved his love.
- **Divine Energy**: He then feels something more - a deep powerful energy in his entire body - something old, something powerful - more powerful than he has ever experienced.
- **Painful Transition**: Suddenly, pain - fire in his veins. He looks at his hands and sees his scales are glowing white - he feels like he's dying.
- **Power Surge**: But the pain leaves, shuts off like a switch. The power remains though - he can see only white as he fully glows with the divine.
- **Healing**: Then, the power runs back down, but still, he feels incredible - he feels his wounds close up, his tired soul be healed. His vision comes back as his glowing fades.
- **Realization**: He sees nothing left of his husband, not his belt, not his armor. He expects an Olympic item, but there is none. He puts two and two together and realizes that... it's impossible, but it's the only thing that makes sense.
- **New Strength**: He stands and looks over the destruction of their fight. He feels stronger than ever - isn't sleepy, isn't tired.
- **Testing Powers**: He feels his magic is stronger and attempts to cast some simple spell to feel out his current status. It emerges with wholly unexpected force, about 3 times what he meant.
- **Emotional Processing**: He is somewhat shocked, and sits and walks over to the river. He has had a long day, and while not tired physically (anymore), he was emotionally exhausted.
- **Thoughts of Odinn**: He spared a thought to his husband who was now being onboarded by the other gods. His husband, a god, he thinks to himself.
- **Prayer and Meditation**: He doesn't believe he will receive it, but sends a quick prayer of love to his husband. He sits by the river and meditates to help with the emotions and wait for his husband to reach out.

## Phase 7: Divine Intervention
- Alytica felt a strong wind around him that broke him out of his meditation. he opened his eyes and saw a god standing before him. She introduced herself as Inkozana, and said that something new happened. She explained that Odinn had ascended, but that the olympic item wasn't created like normal. She explained that Alytica *was* the Olympic item.
- Alytica said he already knew that, but asked how Inozana knew. She explained that she had been watching the fight, and she had wathced his husband ascend. She was a little offput by his calm demeanor, though during her documentation of odinns story, she wasn't entirely shocked
- She explained that she was here to pick him up and take him to the divine council. They had questions for him.
- He asked if he would be able to see his husband, she said yes, after the councils questioning. She reassured him that it wasn't anything bad and he wasn't in danger or trouble, they just wanted to know more about the situation and circumstances and how a mortal could become an olympic item.
- He agreed to go, and they left for the divine council. Inkozana snapped her fingers and they were in a room with a long table and 8 chairs All facing toward him -  5 were occupied by various gods, and 3 were empty
- a seat was available for him in the middle of the room for questioning he presumed, and he sat down at the empty chair. in the middle of the room
- Inko Introduced him to the gods, as he sat down. and he was asked to tell his story. and she sat off to the side.
- He told them about the trial and his relationship with Odinn, and how he ascended, and the use of narn magic and the feywild flower.
- The gods asked about the flower and how long he had used the narn magic during the fight - he said he didn't know, but it was a lot.
- They asked more questions, and he answered them to the best of his ability.
- He was asked to leave the room, and the gods conferred.
- Inko came back and said that they will probably be talking and studying this even for a long time - and that he was free to go home if he wanted
- but he asked if instead he could to go to the onboarding room to see his husband.
- Inko said that was not normally allowed, but she knows the person onboarding Odinn and that they would be fine with it, and snapped her fingers and they were in the onboarding room.
- He saw his husband there, and they embraced.

## Phase 8: Aftermath and Apotheosis
- **New Beginning**: Together again, they build a new cabin and garden beside a river in the Astral Plane. God and immortal, forever.
