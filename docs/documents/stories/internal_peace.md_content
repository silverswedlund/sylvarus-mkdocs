- she gives her niece the throne, a woman who reminds her of a version of her younger self, but better, more kind, and smarter, though much less intense. But she will learn to be a great empress.

- She reconnects with an old flame from the army and gets in touch
- he is a humble merchant now, a man who lives a quiet life. He lives in a medium sized village and is liked by the town.
- Some people push him to running for mayor but he is happy being a merchant.
- "if I were mayor, who would sell you spices?" he would always ask
- She stays with him for a time, the coals of their relationship rekindling
- They fall deeply in love, and hestia helps with the shop

- one day, hestia finds him with another woman
- she is heartbroken, and the fire of her hate and her rage is re-ignited in an instant

  - And stops.
  - He hasn't ever been that happy with her
  - and it's legitimate happiness too, it isn't something that's just a show
- **The Revelation:**
  - She was about to burn someone in hate, someone she loves
  - She was going to escalate immensely, and murder someone because of her fury.
  - just as the dwarves had burned her town in their hatred.
  - Just as *she* had burned theirs.
  - She realizes: she's been an instrument of hate, cloaked in righteousness.
  - The war, the deaths, the conquest—it was all pointless.

## VI. Hollow Descent

- Wracked with guilt and shame, Hestia isolates herself. She leaves a note for her fiance, saying she forgives him and she hopes he's happy, and she leaves without seeing him again.
- She escapes the material plane, and lives in the Feywilds, gambling, drinking, wasting time and pain.
- She drinks and gambles in excess, and is a bit of a recluse, she is a great gambler when sober. But when drunk she is famously terrible. And people took advantage of this and she lost a lot of money. But she had plenty from her former life. Growing bored, she decides to do something a bit more fun
- She joins a group of younger adventurers, who are in the feywilds to find some artifact for their patron. but one night, she goes to a nearby cave to drink in peace, and passes out.
  - A titan ambushes the adventurers while she is gone and unconcious, and the adventurers are all killed
  - She finds what little remains of her new friends and she sobers up—for good.
- The rage burns again. she hunts and burns the titan. killing it with her fury and fire and her hatred.
- but the revenge, again, is pointless. She feels nothing after the titan is dead. 
- She realizes that her hatred, is just like her drinking. It's a way to escape her pain - and it hurts her and never truly makes her feel better.
- She is left with the remains of her friends, and the guilt of their deaths.
- She also realizes that her guilt is the same as her hatred. It's just a way to push herself away from her pain. it makes the death about her, and not about the people she cared for. 
- She recovers her friends and buries them, she colects their belongings, and over the next few months tracks down their next of kin and returns their belongings. Not out of guilt, nor shame, but just because she knew it's what they would have wanted, and she cared for them
 - after, she returned to the feywilds
 - She found peace in the outer reaches where the feywilds are untamed and filled with chaos magic
 - She took up meditation and built herself a small cabin in the woods.
 - She went hunting for food, as she often did.
 - and when she was back, she found a lava slime, a rare creature, had entered her home
 - it, like her, was also looking for food
 - which it found in her home. 
 - but it also lit her home on fire
 - she returned home and found her home burnt to the ground, once again, her home was gone
 - once again though, she was unharmed.
 - the lavaslime was off to the side eating one of her leather boots and she smiled
 - she sat down and the lavaslime came to her, mistaking her innate fire magic for an actual fire
 - she could rebuild her house, or she could move, she found either option perfectly fine. She didn't much care, but she was amused at the little slime and how much they reminded her of herself
 - striving for food, or power, and burning stuff along the way.
 - she cast a quick heat protextion spell and pet the little slime, she gave it some fire as a treat as well.
 - the slime was happy. 
 - and she felt like she had nothing. No home, no family, no rage, no fire, no hate. no shame or guilt or ambition even anymore. Just mild amusement at this little slime and the peculiar little life both it and she had lived. She was amused by the irony of it all.
 - And she found a level of peace she had never known before.
 - but it still wasn't true internal peace, and that was okay with her

---

## VII. Ascension

- Alone in the wilds, she lives a simple life. Her pet lava slime is her only companion.
- they are stupid and cute, and she loves them.
- She no longer *wants* to ascend. She no longer *tries*.
- Not that she thinks it would be preferential to become a titan, it's just that she doesn't care much
- One morning, by a misty lake, she sits in silence in a hammock she had fashioned a few days previously.
- She plays with fire absent mindedly making small dragons and shapes out of the small blue flame in her hands.
- She looks out over the lake. She thinks it's a nice place. She percieves the world, and she feels… peace. She feels… peace.
- In that moment, her fire is not destructive—it is warm.
- She ascends, not with flames, but in stillness.

---

## Themes & Legacy

- **Fire** is not just power—it is emotion. Passion, grief, rage, warmth.
- **Inner peace is not victory—it is surrender.**
- Hestia's story is a warning and a hope: even those forged in trauma can find peace, but only by letting go of the fire that once saved them.

Chapter I: Embers
Under pale skies and quiet snowmelt, in a town that clung like a spiderweb to the borders of two ancient nations. This is where the girl was born. It was a place of thin soil, deep forests, and deeper grudges. Elves lived on one side of the river; dwarves, on the other. History had left scars on both peoples—skirmishes, treaties, betrayals carved into stone—but in the border town of Brell'elmeer, necessity dulled hatred into something almost bearable.

She was born premaurely to a family of elves on their respective side of the border. Her father was a merchant, and her mother was a healer. She was the youngeest of three, and her mother didn't think she would live. She was strong though and her parents gave her a name that meant resilience in elvish, Hestia.

Her brother Tholalen, quick-witted and fearless, was seventeen. Her sister Sapharill, calm and stubborn, was fourteen. Hestia had just turned twelve, all wide eyes and boundless energy. She was too young to remember the last flare-up between the nations, too young to understand why the adults in town whispered when the wind blew from the east. What she did know, with the clarity only children possess, was that she had a best friend.

Her name was Darny, a dwarven girl from the stone village across the water. They met in the woods, pretending to hunt spirits and chasing fireflies, trading stories and carved beads. Darny spoke of dwarven cities beneath the mountains, and how her father was making so many cool swords and blades. Hestia spoke of elven trees that bloomed once a decade, and a volcano in her people's homeland that a legendary elf filled with sand the color of coal. They enjoyed eachothers company and they were sure they would grow up and change the world—together.

But the world isn't easily changed.

When the army came, it didn’t arrive in force. Just a few scouts at first. Then came the supply caravans. Then the conscription papers. The elders called it “precaution,” and no one dared speak of war aloud, but fortifications rose like weeds around the edges of Belmire. Hestia saw her brother sharpen his wooden practice sword each morning, and her father and mother arguing about the future. She saw her sister sit too long staring into nothing. Darny stopped appearing in the woods.

Then came the fire.

It wasn’t the fire Hestia would one day learn to wield. It was fire from the east—screams in the night, metal on stone, boots breaking doors. Hestia awoke to smoke, her sister yanking her from bed. Her parents were in the kitchen, shouting. Then the door splintered inward.

The soldiers wore armor of blackened steel and spoke no words. One of them grabbed their father, and beat him with his metal-clad fist. He shouted at him asking him where the gold was kept. her father told him after several blows. He was synically thanked for his cooperation immediatly before being subjected to a quick slash to the throat. Blood was everywhere. 

Thalen tried to fight, and was thrown aside like a doll. Their mother was the next to rise. She reached for her husband, it wasn't too late if she could heal him. She was cut down before she could even get close.

more blood, more screams, more pain, the sound of gold being taken, and her sister screaming and crying.

her brother was yelling and trying to fight, but was subdued, and as the soldier drew his sword to kill him, hestia felt panic, and rage, and fear and hate. A wave of heat unlike anything she had ever felt before washed over her.

Time felt slow, and the world was silent.

Hestia didn’t remember what she screamed. She only remembered the heat. The sound of rushing wind, of wood cracking from within. The pain—but not hers. Her skin was untouched. Her brother's and sister’s faces were pale with terror, but unburned. The soldiers, the walls, the floor—everything else was flame.

Radient, hot destruction, and she was the source. She felt her rage consume her like the fire consumed the house and the dwarves. She felt faint and dizzy. 

She collapsed into Sapharill's arms as the house groaned around them.

Outside, the battle had barely begun. The dwarves, startled by the resistance, chose brutality over retreat. They set fire to the village and locked the gates that was once their safety. Trapping the townspeople inside of the fort to burn. They dragged out those who remained. Their mission changed from conquest to punishment.

Thalen new a side exit, a path through a drainage ditch, and found a path through the fields for his remaining family, he carried Hestia on his back, and dragged Sapharill by the hand. The three of them ran, Sapharill barefoot and sobbing. Thalen was sweating and breathing hard, fueled by adrenaline. Hestia was mostly unconscious but the heat still clung to her hair like breath. 

They did not look back. Not when they heard screaming. Not when the sky glowed orange. 

By dawn, Brell'elmeer was gone.

They hid in the mountains for two days before help came. Soldiers from the capital—too late to save anyone. Too late to stop the burning.

Hestia stood at the edge of a cliff that morning, her brother beside her, his knuckles white on the hilt of a scavenged blade. Her sister said nothing. None of them did. Not until Hestia finally broke the silence, voice hoarse and dry and small:

“I’ll burn them all.”

No one told her not to.
No one told her she was wrong.

They were all thinking it too.
