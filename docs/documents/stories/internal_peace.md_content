## VI. Hollow Descent

- Wracked with guilt and shame, Hestia isolates herself. She leaves a note for her fiance, saying she forgives him and she hopes he's happy, and she leaves without seeing him again.
- She escapes the material plane, and lives in the Feywilds, gambling, drinking, wasting time and pain.
- She drinks and gambles in excess, and is a bit of a recluse, she is a great gambler when sober. But when drunk she is famously terrible. And people took advantage of this and she lost a lot of money. But she had plenty from her former life. Growing bored, she decides to do something a bit more fun
- She joins a group of younger adventurers, who are in the feywilds to find some artifact for their patron. but one night, she goes to a nearby cave to drink in peace, and passes out.
  - A titan ambushes the adventurers while she is gone and unconcious, and the adventurers are all killed
  - She finds what little remains of her new friends and she sobers up—for good.
- The rage burns again. she hunts and burns the titan. killing it with her fury and fire and her hatred.
- but the revenge, again, is pointless. She feels nothing after the titan is dead. 
- She realizes that her hatred, is just like her drinking. It's a way to escape her pain - and it hurts her and never truly makes her feel better.
- She is left with the remains of her friends, and the guilt of their deaths.
- She also realizes that her guilt is the same as her hatred. It's just a way to push herself away from her pain. it makes the death about her, and not about the people she cared for. 
- She recovers her friends and buries them, she colects their belongings, and over the next few months tracks down their next of kin and returns their belongings. Not out of guilt, nor shame, but just because she knew it's what they would have wanted, and she cared for them
 - after, she returned to the feywilds
 - She found peace in the outer reaches where the feywilds are untamed and filled with chaos magic
 - She took up meditation and built herself a small cabin in the woods.
 - She went hunting for food, as she often did.
 - and when she was back, she found a lava slime, a rare creature, had entered her home
 - it, like her, was also looking for food
 - which it found in her home. 
 - but it also lit her home on fire
 - she returned home and found her home burnt to the ground, once again, her home was gone
 - once again though, she was unharmed.
 - the lavaslime was off to the side eating one of her leather boots and she smiled
 - she sat down and the lavaslime came to her, mistaking her innate fire magic for an actual fire
 - she could rebuild her house, or she could move, she found either option perfectly fine. She didn't much care, but she was amused at the little slime and how much they reminded her of herself
 - striving for food, or power, and burning stuff along the way.
 - she cast a quick heat protextion spell and pet the little slime, she gave it some fire as a treat as well.
 - the slime was happy. 
 - and she felt like she had nothing. No home, no family, no rage, no fire, no hate. no shame or guilt or ambition even anymore. Just mild amusement at this little slime and the peculiar little life both it and she had lived. She was amused by the irony of it all.
 - And she found a level of peace she had never known before.
 - but it still wasn't true internal peace, and that was okay with her

---

## VII. Ascension

- Alone in the wilds, she lives a simple life. Her pet lava slime is her only companion.
- they are stupid and cute, and she loves them.
- She no longer *wants* to ascend. She no longer *tries*.
- Not that she thinks it would be preferential to become a titan, it's just that she doesn't care much
- One morning, by a misty lake, she sits in silence in a hammock she had fashioned a few days previously.
- She plays with fire absent mindedly making small dragons and shapes out of the small blue flame in her hands.
- She looks out over the lake. She thinks it's a nice place. She percieves the world, and she feels… peace. She feels… peace.
- In that moment, her fire is not destructive—it is warm.
- She ascends, not with flames, but in stillness.

---

## Themes & Legacy

- **Fire** is not just power—it is emotion. Passion, grief, rage, warmth.
- **Inner peace is not victory—it is surrender.**
- Hestia's story is a warning and a hope: even those forged in trauma can find peace, but only by letting go of the fire that once saved them.

## Chapter I: Embers

Under pale skies and quiet snowmelt, in a town that clung like a spiderweb to the borders of two ancient nations, a girl was born. It was a place of thin soil, deep forests, and deeper grudges. Elves lived on one side of the river; dwarves, on the other. History had left scars on both peoples—skirmishes, treaties, betrayals carved into stone—but in the border town of Brell'elmeer, necessity dulled hatred into something almost bearable.

She was born prematurely to a family of elves on their respective side of the border. Her father was a merchant, and her mother was a healer. She was the youngest of three, and her mother didn't think she would live. She was strong, though, and her parents gave her a name that meant resilience in Elvish: Hestia.

Her brother Tholalen, quick-witted and fearless, was seventeen. Her sister Sapharill, calm and stubborn, was fourteen. Hestia had just turned twelve, all wide eyes and boundless energy. She was too young to remember the last flare-up between the nations, too young to understand why the adults in town whispered when the wind blew from the east. What she did know, with the clarity only children possess, was that she had a best friend.

Her name was Darny, a dwarven girl from the stone village across the water. They met in the woods, pretending to hunt spirits and chasing fireflies, trading stories and carved beads. Darny spoke of dwarven cities beneath the mountains and how her father was making so many cool swords and blades. Hestia spoke of elven trees that bloomed once a decade and a volcano in her people's homeland that a legendary elf filled with sand the color of coal. They enjoyed each other's company and were sure they would grow up and change the world—together.

But the world isn't easily changed.

When the army came, it didn't arrive in force. Just a few scouts at first. Then came the supply caravans. Then the conscription papers. The elders called it "precaution," and no one dared speak of war aloud, but fortifications rose like weeds around the edges of Brell'elmeer. Hestia saw her brother sharpen his wooden practice sword each morning, and her father and mother arguing about the future. She saw her sister sit too long, staring into nothing. Darny stopped appearing in the woods.

Then came the fire.

It wasn't the fire Hestia would one day learn to wield. It was fire from the east—screams in the night, metal on stone, boots breaking doors. Hestia awoke to smoke, her sister yanking her from bed. Her parents were in the kitchen, shouting. Then the door splintered inward.

The soldiers wore armor of blackened steel and spoke no words. One of them grabbed their father and beat him with his metal-clad fist. He shouted at him, asking where the gold was kept. Her father told him after several blows. He was cynically thanked for his cooperation immediately before being subjected to a quick slash to the throat. Blood was everywhere.

Tholalen tried to fight and was thrown aside like a doll. Their mother was the next to rise. She reached for her husband; it wasn't too late if she could heal him. She was cut down before she could even get close.

More blood, more screams, more pain, the sound of gold being taken, and her sister screaming and crying.

Her brother was yelling and trying to fight but was subdued, and as the soldier drew his sword to kill him, Hestia felt panic, rage, fear, and hate. A wave of heat unlike anything she had ever felt before washed over her.

Time felt slow, and the world was silent.

Hestia didn't remember what she screamed. She only remembered the heat. The sound of rushing wind, of wood cracking from within. The pain—but not hers. Her skin was untouched. Her brother's and sister's faces were pale with terror, but unburned. The soldiers, the walls, the floor—everything else was flame.

Radiant, hot destruction, and she was the source. She felt her rage consume her like the fire consumed the house and the dwarves. She felt faint and dizzy.

She collapsed into Sapharill's arms as the house groaned around them.

Outside, the battle had barely begun. The dwarves, startled by the resistance, chose brutality over retreat. They set fire to the village and locked the gates that were once their safety, trapping the townspeople inside the fort to burn. They dragged out those who remained. Their mission changed from conquest to punishment.

Tholalen knew a side exit, a path through a drainage ditch, and found a path through the fields for his remaining family. He carried Hestia on his back and dragged Sapharill by the hand. The three of them ran, Sapharill barefoot and sobbing. Tholalen was sweating and breathing hard, fueled by adrenaline. Hestia was mostly unconscious, but the heat still clung to her hair like breath.

They did not look back. Not when they heard screaming. Not when the sky glowed orange.

By dawn, Brell'elmeer was gone.

They hid in the mountains for two days before help came. Soldiers from the capital—too late to save anyone. Too late to stop the burning.

Hestia stood at the edge of a cliff that morning, her brother beside her, his knuckles white on the hilt of a scavenged blade. Her sister said nothing. None of them did. Not until Hestia finally broke the silence, her voice hoarse and dry and small:

"I'll burn them all."

No one told her not to.
No one told her she was wrong.

They were all thinking it too.


## Chapter II: Pyre
They settled in the lowlands beyond the capital, in a quiet farmhouse where the air never smelled of blood. A place that didn't know the taste of war. Their grandparents were old—gentle, slow-speaking, and fond of stories that only half made sense. Hestia's brother Tholalen took to fixing things. Her sister Sapharill took to silence. And Hestia… she smoldered.

At first, the grief hollowed her out. She didn’t speak much for weeks. Her grandparents tried to coax warmth from her with sweets, stories, and soft hands, but none of it reached her. The girl who used to laugh in the woods was gone. Something colder—or perhaps hotter—had taken her place.

School began soon after, and with it came whispers. Everyone had heard what happened in Brell’elmeer. Everyone knew about the girl who burned down half a battalion. Some feared her. Some admired her. No one understood her.

Hestia didn’t make friends. She made allies.

She sat at the top of her classes, tore through every textbook, every rune-scroll, every combat drill. She raised her hand not to ask questions, but to answer them before anyone else could. She was clever, confident, and, at times, cruel. She mocked the slow. She humiliated the proud. She won every duel.

In many ways, she was simply superior, and she knew it. On one occasion, in the academies halls, she was tearing into a fellow student who made fun of her during class. Nobody challenged her on it, some of the teachers were even scared of her. She began hitting the "disrespectful idiot", at first, it was small pushes, but grew into a full on beating.

But one of her punches was intercepted by a hand. Not by her target, but by an older boy. He was a talented fighter and student. He was strong and fierce like her, but he was kind. The students were all watching.

Nobody knew what was going to happen next. The last person who tried to stop her was nearly killed. 

"You are a good fighter, and I know you are a smart kid," he said, "but you are a brute, a bully, and you are not a good person."

"so, instead of beating up this small boy, why don't you come and fight me? None of your fire, no magic, no weapons, just you and me. Unless... you are afraid to fight me without your fire?"

Students gasped. and were watching with wide eyes. some people tried to get teachers, but he said "no teachers, no parents, okay? this is between us students. We need to learn to deal with each other, or we will never be able to stand up to the real enemies"

She accepted, and they fought.

It was a quick fight, but not a simple or easy one. They struck blows, grappling dodging and countering. He was really skilled. She was too, and she was stronger and quicker than he was., but it wasn't enough, he had the experience, the discipline, the training, and she didn't. she took several solid punches to the face, and a kick to the ribs that likely broke several of them. 

She was furious, and she wanted to win, but he was too good.

She screamed. Nothing in particular, just a shout of rage.

She felt the fire inside her growing. She wanted to burn him. She hated him like she hated the dwarves. She wanted to burn him so badly.

Her eyes glowed with the blue of her fire, and she could feel it, the power building up in her.

He saw it, and he smiled.

he dodged the first fireball, and the second, and closed the distance and with two quick actions, broke her nose, and then her arm. with the pain, she yelled

proud of himself, the boy said, "You are willing to cheat to win, of course you are. You are a pathetic bully after all. And you are a disgrace to your family. Your parents would be ashamed of you."

"Never talk about my family again, or I will burn you alive."

"You are mad because I'm right. I think your parents would not be proud of you beating up a smaller boy."

She came alive with flames, her body cothed in fire, she was fury. She was hate. She was fire.

The boy was stunned, by the display of power, but gained his composure quickly"

"you are bluffing. We both know you could kill me right now. But you won't"

The next few seconds were tense. She was breathing heavily, her chest heaving, her eyes glowing with fire.

they both stood their ground, not a whisper from the crowd.

She contained her fire, and walked away without a word

She changed schools, and her grades were still high, but she was no longer a bully, she was a complete loner. barely speaking to anyone at all. the fire still raging inside her.

By fifteen, she was offered a scholarship to the best magical academy in the region. She accepted without ceremony.

Her grandparents cried with pride. 

The city was grand, and the academy was older than most nations. Marble halls, flame-lit towers, dueling rings carved from obsidian. Here, she was among others with power—but few with purpose. While others trained for prestige or gold or curiosity, Hestia trained for war.

Her hatred had become precise. Focused. She stopped believing in peace altogether. The dwarves had murdered her parents. Burned her home. Laughed while her village died. The empire agreed. The emperor called them lesser beings, beasts, a threat that must be eradicated.

Hestia listened. She was convinced.

By 20, after graduating from the academy, she enlisted.

She accelerated through training. The instructors praised her discipline, her technique, her raw magical output. She wielded fire like it was an extension of her breath. Her spells didn’t just scorch—they roared, they hungered. Her body moved with soldierly precision. Her mind was a blade honed on memory.

And then, in her second year of service, she saw the sky open.

It was during a night patrol along a broken pass, the clouds thick and restless. A gale cut through the trees, and the moon vanished. The others panicked, blades drawn, spells summoned.

But Hestia froze.

A silver light descended, soft and vast, and with it came the shape of a creature more magnificent than she had ever seen—feathered, radiant, haloed in stormlight. A massive winged horse, glowing like the stars themselves.

“Hestia of Brell’elmeer,” it said—not with words, but within her.

“Your trial is to find inner peace.”

She blinked.

Then laughed.

Of all the trials the gods could give, this one was easy. She would finish the war. Burn the beasts. Avenge her parents. Bring peace to the empire. And then she'd find peace. and go live in the woods or something.

The divine creature said nothing more. It simply rose, wheeled once above the mountain, and vanished into mist.

Years passed. Battles flared like brushfires, and she was in all of them.

Hestia became a name known across continents. A legend. A commander with hair like midnight and fire in her veins. Wherever she walked, the air warmed. Wherever she struck, cities fell.

Fire so intense it burned the stone cityies the dwarves built.

The dwarves—divided, desperate—tried to push back. She crushed them. She razed fortresses carved into cliffs. She turned their siege engines to slag with a single word. Her troops followed her not just out of fear, but belief.

She led not from a throne, but from the front lines.

She was a general, a commander, a warrior. She won the war for the elves, drove the dwarves back to the mountains.

The old emperor was dying, and he had no heirs. He had no one to succeed him.

She had a meeting with the old elf and she 'convined' him to declare her his heir.

When he died, Hestia was crowned in the capital’s oldest temple, beneath banners of gold and coal-black. The crowd chanted her name like prayer.

she lead the empire to push their advantage and the dwarves were soon forced to surrender.

She negotiated harsh terms, but the dwarves were desperate and accepted them.
The war was over.

She wore crimson and steel. Her hair braided with firestones. Her crown forged from the remnants of the last dwarven king’s sword.

A hero. A ruler. A flame made flesh.

But when the ceremony ended, and the throne room emptied, and the cheering faded—

She stood alone.

And in the silence, something inside her whispered,

> You are no closer.

She ignored it.

She had peace to enforce.
