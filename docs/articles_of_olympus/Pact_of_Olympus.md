# Pact of Olympus

*Authored by Demeter, in the 9th Epoch of Divine Reckoning*

## Preamble

In the wake of endless conflict, unchecked divine ambition, and growing instability among the immortal, the gods  have come together to forge a sacred covenant. The Pact of Olympus stands as a cornerstone of celestial order, a charter of balance, and a declaration of mutual restraint. It is by this document that divine authority shall be tempered, divine crime punished with justice, and divine cooperation preserved.

This Pact serves to end the wars between gods, establish clear protocols for ascension, governance, and judgment, and preserve the realms mortal and divine from further chaos. Let all deities, great and small, know the binding power of these articles, and let no god stand above the order enshrined herein.

**Signed by:** Fortuna, Midas, Gilgamesh, Hades, Quetzalcoatl  
**Ratified on:** Sylvaren Equinox, 9th Epoch

## Scope of Application

1. This Pact applies to all gods currently in existence, including those who have not signed the Pact.
