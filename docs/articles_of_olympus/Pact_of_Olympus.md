# Pact of [Olympus](../planes/material/sylvarus/locations/territories/olympia/index.md)

*Authored by [Demeter](../entities/gods/demeter/index.md), during the Time of the God wars

## Preamble

In the wake of endless conflict, unchecked divine ambition, and growing instability among the immortal, the gods have come together to forge a sacred covenant. The Pact of [Olympus](../planes/material/sylvarus/locations/territories/olympia/index.md) stands as a cornerstone of celestial order, a charter of balance, and a declaration of mutual restraint. It is by this document that divine authority shall be tempered, divine crime punished with justice, and divine cooperation preserved.

This Pact serves to end the wars between gods, establish clear protocols for ascension, governance, and judgment, and preserve the realms mortal and divine from further chaos. Let all deities, great and small, know the binding power of these articles, and let no god stand above the order enshrined herein.

**Signed by:** [Fortuna](../entities/gods/fortuna/index.md), [Midas](../entities/gods/midas/index.md), [Gilgamesh](../entities/gods/gilgamesh/index.md), [Hades](../entities/gods/hades/index.md), [Quetzalcoatl](../entities/gods/quetzalcoatl/index.md)
