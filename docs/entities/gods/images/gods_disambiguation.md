# Gods of Sylvarus  
The gods of Sylvarus, also known as the Olympians, are immensely powerful spiritual beings who form part of an Olympic pantheon. These gods are ascended beings, having achieved godhood through the completion of their divine trials. Only sparkbearers are eligible for these trials, and upon successful completion, they are granted godhood and become a god of Sylvarus. At this point, they are integrated into the pantheon as mandated by the Pact of Olympus.

## Characteristics  
The gods possess extraordinary power, both physically and magically. Few other entities can rival their might. Notable exceptions include Titans, Chaos Deities, and Archangels. While some wizards, sparkbearers, liches, lord vampires, and other entities may approach their level of power, they still fall short of the gods' capabilities.

Despite their formidable nature, gods can be killed, though it is an incredibly challenging feat. As spiritual beings, their physical forms are merely vessels, which they can change at will. If a vessel is destroyed, they can simply switch to or create another one.

## Ascension and Vessels  
Upon ascension, a god's physical body is destroyed, and they must design a new vessel during the onboarding process. This new vessel reflects their divine nature and is crafted to suit their preferences and powers.
